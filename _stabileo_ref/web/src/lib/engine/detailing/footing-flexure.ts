/**
 * Bottom-mat flexural design for an isolated footing — CIRSOC 201-2025 Chapter 13.
 *
 * ── What was here before ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `foundation-check.ts` computed ONE factored moment: the §13.2.7 cantilever integral about
 * the B axis, reported as `FootingCheck.Mu`, with the memo saying "la armadura de flexión se
 * dimensiona con el verificador de secciones". Nothing dimensioned it. The record's flexure
 * outcome was UNSUPPORTED with `footing.record.flexureNoSteel`, which was honest, and the
 * other direction of a two-way mat did not exist at all.
 *
 * This module is the missing design. It produces, per direction and separately:
 *
 *   * the demand, from the same trapezoidal soil-pressure integral the check already uses;
 *   * the steel required by FLEXURAL STRENGTH;
 *   * the steel required by the MINIMUM-reinforcement clause;
 *   * which of the two governs;
 *   * an integer bar count and layout that satisfies every applicable spacing limit;
 *   * the §13.3.3 distribution regions the bars belong in.
 *
 * It does NOT generate bars. No physical mat geometry exists after this runs, and the
 * record's `geometry` stays REQUIRED_NOT_MODELED so a footing with a designed-but-undrawn
 * mat cannot read as a verified footing.
 *
 * ── The verified clause chain ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Read off the ENACTED Annex IV of CIRSOC 201-2025 (Resolución 11/2025, InfoLeg 422490),
 * not an ACI summary and not the 2024 draft:
 *
 * §13.3.3.1  the design and detailing of two-way isolated footings shall comply with §13.3.3
 *            AND the applicable provisions of Chapters 7 and 8 — this is what makes every
 *            Chapter 7 rule below applicable to a footing at all.
 * §13.2.6.6  the external moment at any section is found by passing a vertical plane through
 *            the member and taking the moment of the forces on the whole area on one side of
 *            it. That integral, not a coefficient.
 * §13.2.7.1  Table: the critical section for M_u is at the FACE of the column or pedestal.
 * §13.3.1.2  the total depth shall be chosen so the effective depth of the bottom
 *            reinforcement is at least 150 mm.
 * §7.6.1     minimum flexural reinforcement in non-prestressed slabs: A_s,min = 0,0018 A_g.
 *            §8.6.1.1 states the same 0,0018 A_g for two-way slabs, so the two chapters
 *            §13.3.3.1 makes applicable agree and there is nothing to reconcile.
 * §7.7.2.1   the minimum spacing s shall comply with §25.2.
 * §25.2.1    clear distance ≥ max(25 mm, d_b, (4/3) d_agg).
 * §7.7.2.2   for non-prestressed slabs, the spacing of the bonded reinforcement closest to
 *            the tension face shall not exceed the value given in §24.3.
 * §24.3.2    Table 24.3.2 — see `crack-control.ts` for the expression.
 * §7.7.2.3   the maximum spacing of longitudinal deformed reinforcement shall be the LESSER
 *            of 3h and 300 mm. Three hundred, verified verbatim in the enacted text. The
 *            2024 draft's 450 mm is not in it; 450 mm appears in §7.7.2.4, which is the
 *            shrinkage-and-temperature rule and a different requirement.
 * §13.3.3.2  in SQUARE two-way footings the reinforcement shall be distributed uniformly
 *            across the full width in both directions.
 * §13.3.3.3  in RECTANGULAR footings: (a) the long-direction reinforcement is distributed
 *            uniformly across the full width; (b) of the short-direction reinforcement, the
 *            portion γs·A_s is distributed uniformly in a band whose width equals the SHORT
 *            side of the footing, centred on the column or pedestal axis, and the remainder
 *            (1 − γs)·A_s uniformly in the zones outside that band, with
 *
 *                γs = 2 / (β + 1)          (13.3.3.3)
 *
 *            where β is the ratio of the long side to the short side.
 * §13.2.8.1  anchorage of the reinforcement shall comply with Chapter 25; §13.2.8.3 puts the
 *            critical sections for anchorage at the §13.2.7.1 locations. The development
 *            length is reported here for the selected bar; whether the physical bar achieves
 *            it is a question about geometry that does not exist yet, and this module makes
 *            no anchorage claim.
 *
 * ── Two things this module deliberately does not do ────────────
 *
 * It does not use `checkFlexure().AsMin`. That is the BEAM minimum,
 * `max(0,25√f'c/f_y, 1,4/f_y)·b_w·d` from §9.6.1.2, and it is not the clause a footing mat
 * answers to. What it DOES reuse from `checkFlexure` is the rectangular stress block, via the
 * new `AsFlexural` output — the strength requirement on its own. Writing the stress block out
 * again here would make this a second flexural engine.
 *
 * It does not use `seedAreaFor`. That is a candidate-search ordering heuristic; it has no
 * design authority.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes. Forces kN, moments kN·m, lengths m, pressures kPa, areas m².

 *   2. the resulting centre spacing must not exceed the governing maximum, which can force
 *      MORE bars than the area alone asks for and routinely does on a minimum-governed mat;
 *   3. the resulting clear spacing must not fall below §25.2.1, which caps the count from
 *      above. When the floor from (1) and (2) passes that cap there is no admissible layout
 *      at the selected diameter, and this returns a failure instead of quietly changing the
 *      diameter the engineer chose.
 *
 * ── And one coordination requirement: keep the centre line clear ────
 *
 * `avoidBarOnCentre` asks for a count that leaves the region's own centre line free of steel.
 * It is not an aesthetic preference and it is not the code speaking; it is a measured
 * constructibility constraint between this mat and the column above it.
 *
 * A column's certified eight-bar cage carries one longitudinal bar CENTRED on each face, so on
 * a concentric footing four starter dowels stand exactly on the two centre lines. A mat bar on
 * the same line sits directly beneath one of them, and it removes the only hook orientation
 * that dowel has: the leg that turns perpendicular to its own face is carried by the crossed
 * layer, must drop through the layer above, and finds that line already occupied — measured
 * interpenetration 16,00 mm, one full mat-bar diameter, axes coincident. What is left are the
 * along-face orientations, whose legs run 1,76 mm from the corner bars' line at the same
 * elevation, and those clash too.
 *
 * Measured on the production footing, 2,00 × 2,00 × 0,50 m with a 400 mm column carrying 8Ø20:
 *
 *   9 Ø16 per direction (odd)  → 0 feasible hook arrangements, exhaustive
 *   10 Ø16 per direction (even) → 496, every hook seated, 135,24 mm between hooks
 *   11 (odd) → 0     12 (even) → 496
 *
 * Parity is the whole of it. So an odd count gets ONE more bar, which costs steel the demand
 * did not ask for — 18,10 → 20,11 cm² on that footing — and buys a cage that can be built. The
 * extra bar is reported in the steps rather than folded into the area narrative, because a
 * reader comparing provided against required is owed the reason for the difference.
 *
 * When the §25.2.1 cap will not admit the extra bar the odd count STANDS. Nothing here silently
 * changes the diameter or drops below the clear-spacing minimum to satisfy a coordination rule,
 * and the consequence is not hidden either: the dowel cage measures the same conflict and
 * refuses to emit an unbuildable cage, naming the dowels involved.
 *
 * The rule keys on the REGION's centre, not on the column's axis, and those coincide only on a
 * concentric footing. On one with plan eccentricity the dowels do not stand on the centre line
 * and this buys nothing — the cage still measures the real geometry and still refuses when it
 * has to. A rule stated in terms this function can actually see is worth more than one that
 * pretends to a generality it does not have.

 * The governing critical section on one axis.

 * ── What this replaces, and why ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first version took ONE cantilever, `(S − columnDimension)/2`, which is the symmetric
 * value. `eccentricityB`/`eccentricityL` are not load eccentricities — `model/footing.ts`
 * defines them as the plan offset of the footing CENTROID from the supported node, and
 * `punchingPosition` already measures each column face to its own footing edge with them. So
 * the column really is off centre, the two cantilevers really are unequal, and the symmetric
 * value UNDER-states the longer one. A note about that is not good enough: it is the side that
 * governs.
 *
 * ── The envelope ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two things move independently, so both faces are evaluated under both:
 *
 *   * the GEOMETRIC offset of the column, whose direction is known;
 *   * the applied moment, whose sign is NOT usable here. The demand arrives as a reaction
 *     moment on global axes and the shared authority already discards its sign
 *     (`Math.abs`), because resolving a reaction-moment sign onto a footing-local axis is
 *     a separate piece of work this module must not guess at.
 *
 * So the moment is applied in both orientations and the worst of the four combinations
 * governs. That is sign-agnostic and cannot under-state the demand; the cost is that a footing
 * is occasionally designed for a diagram the real sign would not produce.
 *
 * The pressure is the same linear distribution the shared authority integrates,
 * `q(u) = q0 (1 + 12 u_R u / S²)`, written about the centroid so an off-centre resultant is
 * expressible at all. At `u = ±S/2` it reduces to `q0 (1 ± 6 e/S)` — the `1 ± k` form
 * `checkFooting` uses — so a centred column reproduces that result exactly.

   * The enacted clause defines it as "la menor distancia desde la SUPERFICIE de la armadura
   * conformada […] a la cara traccionada", and C 24.3.2 narrows what it applies to: "solamente
   * la armadura de tracción más cercana a la cara traccionada necesita ser considerada para
   * seleccionar el valor de cc". §7.7.2.2 routes the same way — "la armadura adherente más
   * cercana a la cara en tracción".
   *
   * So the clause targets the LOWER layer, whose bar surface sits exactly one clear cover from
   * the tension face. Whichever of the two directions ends up lower, that number is the same
   * `cover`, which is why this needs no layer order.
   *
   * The first version used `cover + d_b,other` here — the upper layer's distance. That is not
   * the cc §24.3.2 defines for the bar it limits, and it happened to be MORE restrictive
   * (215 mm against 255 mm on the reference footing), so the error was conservative rather
   * than unsafe. It was still the wrong number attributed to the clause.
   *
   * The resulting limit is applied to BOTH directions. The lower layer must satisfy it and this
   * stage does not know which direction that is; imposing it on the upper layer as well is an
   * extra requirement the clause does not make of it, in the safe direction.

 * Select the physical layer order.

 * ── Why AUTO evaluates rather than reasons ─────────────────────
 *
 * "Put the direction with the larger moment lower" is the rule of thumb, and it is not reliable
 * here. The deeper layer is worth a full bar diameter of `d`, which matters most where the steel
 * is FLEXURE-governed; but a mat direction is frequently MINIMUM-governed (§7.6.1's 0,0018 A_g
 * does not depend on `d` at all), and then the extra depth buys nothing while the other
 * direction's loss costs real steel. Whether the swap helps also depends on the two diameters,
 * on which direction §13.3.3.3 bands, and on the integer bar counts — the layout rounds up, so
 * a small change in required area can move a whole bar. So AUTO designs BOTH arrangements
 * completely and compares the results, which is the only way the answer is right for the reasons
 * it claims.
 *
 * ── The stated rule, in order ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. reject an arrangement that cannot produce a code-compliant layout in both directions;
 *   2. prefer the smaller total provided steel mass;
 *   3. on a tie, prefer the smaller worst flexural steel utilisation — more margin;
 *   4. still tied, `X_BELOW_Y`, so the answer is stable across runs and machines.
 *
 * Step 4 is reached by a square footing with equal diameters and equal moments, where the two
 * arrangements are genuinely indistinguishable. It exists so that case has ONE answer rather
 * than one that depends on comparison order.
