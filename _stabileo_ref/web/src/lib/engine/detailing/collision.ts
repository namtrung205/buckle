/**
 * Bar-to-bar collision detection with a broad-phase spatial index.
 *
 * The question this answers is the one a section check cannot: "will this cage actually
 * assemble on site?" Two Ø25 bars whose centrelines pass 20 mm apart both satisfy every
 * strength check and physically cannot both exist.
 *
 * Design decisions worth stating:
 *
 *   * A bar is treated as a swept capsule around its sampled centreline, not as a line.
 *     Clearance is measured surface to surface, which is what the code's clear-spacing
 *     rules and a steel fixer both mean.
 *
 *   * Bars that share an owner element and the same role and layer are NOT exempt from
 *     checking. The layout code is exactly what this is meant to catch.
 *
 *   * A collision is reported with the pair, the location and the shortfall, never as a
 *     bare boolean. "There is a clash" is not actionable; "these two bars are 12 mm
 *     apart at x = 2.35 m and need 25 mm" is.
 *
 *   * When the engine cannot resolve a clash it emits an explicit unresolved conflict.
 *     Silently dropping a bar to make the cage fit would be inventing a design.
 *
 * Complexity: the broad phase is a uniform spatial hash, so the pair test is
 * O(n · k) with k the local density rather than O(n²). On a joint with 40 incident bars
 * that is the difference between 1600 and roughly 200 narrow-phase tests.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes.

 * The narrow phase tests straight segments between consecutive samples, so an arc is only
 * ever as accurate as the polyline standing in for it, and every chord cuts INSIDE the true
 * curve. At the 5 mm default a 135° stirrup hook on a Ø8 bar (r = 20 mm) is sampled as TWO
 * chords of 67,5°, each dipping `r(1 − cos 33,75°) = 3,37 mm` inside the bend.
 *
 * That error lands directly in the clearance. Measured on `rc-design-qa-8`: a column corner
 * bar seated in a joint tie's bend — designed contact, true clearance +0,08 mm under dense
 * resampling — was reported as interpenetrating by 3,17 mm, eight times over. The steel was
 * right and the ruler was wrong.
 *
 * The default was harmless while `samplePath` interpolated arcs linearly, because the whole
 * arc was already replaced by its chord and no tolerance could have helped. Once arcs became
 * real geometry the sampling tolerance became a real measurement error, so it is set here to
 * half a millimetre: below any fabrication tolerance, and a quarter of `CONTACT_ALLOWANCE`,
 * so it can never manufacture a contact or a clash on its own.
