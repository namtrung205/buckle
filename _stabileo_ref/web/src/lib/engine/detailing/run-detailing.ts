/**
 * The production path from verified design to coordinated detailing assemblies.
 *
 * ── The gap this closes ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PR17 shipped `generateBeamBars`, `generateColumnStack`, `coordinateJoint`,
 * `detectCollisions` and `coordinateFloor`, all unit-tested, and `detailingStore` with a
 * `setAssemblies` method. The forensic audit found that `setAssemblies` had ZERO callers
 * and `coordinateFloor` had none outside its own tests: the only thing that ever wrote
 * `model.detailing` was a Playwright hook. Every green test described machinery nothing
 * reached.
 *
 * This module is the missing adapter. It takes what the RC design run already produces —
 * member contexts and verified outcomes — and drives the real chain:
 *
 *   verified members
 *     → beam bar paths (curtailment, laps, bent-up policy, stirrup zones)
 *     → column stacks (transitions, splices, ties)
 *     → perpendicular joint coordination
 *     → collision detection and bounded repair
 *     → coordinateFloor
 *     → DetailingAssembly[]
 *
 * The store then persists it and the revision graph invalidates it. Nothing here touches
 * the solver, and nothing here is a hook.
 *
 * ── Honesty rules ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A member that is not VERIFIED never contributes bars. Detailing an unverified member
 * would produce a drawing of reinforcement that has not been shown to work, which is worse
 * than producing no drawing. Such members are reported as prerequisites, by id and count,
 * so the UI can say exactly what is missing rather than "run design first".
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes. The store command supplies the data and consumes the result.
