/**
 * Whole-floor coordination: slabs, walls and foundations into the PR17 assembly model.
 *
 * The point of doing this at floor level rather than per element is that the interfaces
 * are where the mistakes live. Slab top bars and beam top bars occupy the same 60 mm of
 * cover at every support. Column starters have to land inside the footing's bottom mat
 * without displacing it. Wall verticals have to lap with the dowels the foundation left
 * for them. Each element designed alone is correct; assembled, they collide.
 *
 * This module produces `DetailingAssembly` values for the three families, using the same
 * bar-geometry and collision engines PR17 built, so a slab bar and a beam bar are checked
 * against each other by exactly the code that checks two beam bars.
 *
 * ── Interface rules ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §7.7.2 / §8.7.2  slab reinforcement passes over supporting beams; the slab top steel
 *                  sits ABOVE the beam top steel where both are present, because the
 *                  slab bar has the shallower cover requirement and the beam bar is the
 *                  one that must not lose its lever arm.
 * §16.3.4          column-to-footing force transfer: dowels of at least the area
 *                  required, extending a development length into both members.
 * §25.5            lap lengths for the wall/dowel and column/starter splices.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes.

/**
 * How far a slab bar runs past its panel at each end, m.
 *
 * ── What this is, and what it is NOT ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is an anchorage ALLOWANCE: a slab bar has to continue into the support it lands on, so
 * running it exactly to the panel boundary would model a bar that stops in mid-air at the
 * face of every beam. The bars protruding from the concrete in the 3-D view are this, working
 * as designed — not a clipping, transformation or unit error.
 *
 * It is NOT a development length. §25.4 decides `ld` from the bar diameter, the concrete
 * strength, the cover and the bar's position, and `anchorageFunctions` computes exactly that
 * for beams, columns and footing dowels. This constant consults none of it. 150 mm is short
 * of `ld` for most slab bars, so the allowance shown is a placeholder for a number this
 * module does not yet compute.
 *
 * That is why it is DECLARED as an assumption on every floor run rather than left as a
 * literal. A bar that visibly leaves its panel and explains itself is a detail an engineer
 * can accept or reject; the same bar with no explanation is the app appearing to be wrong.
 *
 * Exported so the containment test can state the bound it is checking against, rather than
 * repeating the number and drifting from it.

   * ZERO applicable frame members, which makes the two frame conditions vacuously true — and
