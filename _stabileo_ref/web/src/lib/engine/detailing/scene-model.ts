/**
 * The SceneModel: the 3-D view as a PROJECTION of the document, not a second reading of it.
 *
 * ── Why this module exists at all ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `DocumentModel` was built on one rule: a report, a drawing set and a schedule of the same
 * floor are three renderings of ONE statement about the structure, so they are assembled
 * once and projected three ways. Anything absent from the model cannot appear in an output,
 * and anything in it appears in all of them consistently.
 *
 * A 3-D view of the reinforcement is a fourth rendering of that same statement, and it was
 * about to be built the way such views usually are: by walking the store, reading bars off
 * whatever assembly happened to be selected, and drawing tubes. That produces a picture that
 * is *nearly* the drawing — right until the day it is not, and then nobody can say which of
 * the two is lying. The failure is silent and it is discovered on site.
 *
 * So the scene is a projection like the other three. It reads the document and only the
 * document, it samples each bar with `samplePath` — the SAME function the elevations and the
 * clash check call, at the same chord tolerance — and it carries the marks the schedule
 * prints. What you orbit is what you dimension is what you order.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does not do ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * It computes no engineering. Not a bar position, not a clearance, not a bend radius. Every
 * number here was decided upstream by a generator or a coordinator and is copied. A scene
 * builder that re-derived so much as a hook radius would be a second opinion, and two
 * opinions about one hook is how a drawing and a model come to disagree.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes, no i18n, no Three.js, no DOM. The renderer is a separate module
 * so this one stays testable and so a non-WebGL consumer — a snapshot test, an exporter —
 * can read the same scene.
