/**
 * The concrete of a frame member, read from the analysis model.
 *
 * ── The seam this module is ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `buildSceneModel` will not go looking for concrete. It takes what it is given and reports
 * what it is not given, because a projection that reached into live state could show a
 * section edited after the steel was designed — concrete from now wrapped round bars from
 * before, with nothing on screen to reveal it.
 *
 * This is the module that does the reaching, in one place, in the open. It converts nodes,
 * elements and sections into the shape the scene consumes, and it REFUSES rather than guesses:
 * a member whose section states no b and no h produces nothing, lands in the scene's
 * `unresolvedMembers`, and is shown to the user as a member whose concrete is unknown.
 *
 * That refusal is the point. The alternative — falling back to a square of area `a` — would
 * put a plausible box on screen that no one specified, and a plausible wrong box is worse
 * than a visible gap.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes. The caller passes snapshots.
