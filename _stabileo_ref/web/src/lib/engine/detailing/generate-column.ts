/**
 * Column-stack generation and beam-column joint coordination.
 *
 * A column stack is not a list of independent columns. Its bars run through floors, its
 * splices must sit in the permitted zone, its section may change between storeys, and at
 * every level it shares the joint with two to four beams whose top and bottom bars have
 * to pass through the same 400 mm cube. Designing each lift alone produces a set of
 * cages that cannot be assembled.
 *
 * ── Normative content (CIRSOC 201-2025) ────────────────────────
 *
 * §10.7.4  longitudinal bars offset by a change of section — the slope of the inclined
 *          portion shall not exceed 1 in 6, the portions above and below the offset are
 *          parallel to the column axis, and horizontal support must be provided by ties
 *          placed within 150 mm of the bend.
 * §10.7.5  splices of longitudinal reinforcement — lap, mechanical or welded.
 * §10.7.6  transverse reinforcement — ties enclosing the longitudinal bars, spacing not
 *          exceeding the least of 16·d_b(long), 48·d_b(tie) and the least column
 *          dimension.
 * §25.5    splice lengths.
 * §15.2    beam-column joints — the joint must be confined and the beam bars developed.
 *
 * ── Layer allocation at a joint ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two beams framing in perpendicular to each other cannot both put their top bars at the
 * same depth: one set has to sit under the other. The allocation is deterministic — by
 * descending beam depth, then by element id — so the same floor always produces the same
 * drawing. Arbitrary allocation would make every golden test unstable and, worse, would
 * make two runs of the same model produce two different bar schedules.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes.

 * ── The defect this replaces ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every roof hook used to turn along ±x: `hookNormal: { x: -Math.sign(p.x) || 1, y: 0 }`.
 * So every bar on one face pointed its 12db extension along the SAME line at the SAME
 * elevation, and adjacent bars simply overlapped. On the flagship two Ø20 bars on the
 * y = −211 face ran from x = −141 to 99 and from x = −71 to 169, two millimetres apart in
 * z. That is 214 prohibited overlaps, and none of them was a crank: §10.7.4 offset bars
 * never entered into it, because the bars are straight.
 *
 * ── The rule ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A bar's hook turns inward perpendicular to the face it sits on, so every extension on
 * one face is parallel to its neighbours and offset from them by the bar spacing. That
 * alone fixes same-face overlap.
 *
 * It does not fix opposite and adjacent faces: a −y bar's extension runs +y, a +y bar's
 * runs −y, and in a 400 mm column two 240 mm extensions on the same line still meet. So
 * each face also gets its own elevation tier. Within a tier all extensions are parallel
 * and never meet; across tiers they are at different heights and cannot.
 *
 * Corner bars sit on two faces and are assigned to exactly one, deterministically: the
 * face they are closer to, ties broken by face order. A corner bar must not be counted
 * twice or left out.
