/**
 * Slab–column punching: the production collector the engine was waiting for.
 *
 * ── What was missing, and what was not ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * `punching-shear.ts` has been complete since it was written. `derivePunchingDemand` forms
 * the transferred force as `|N_below − N_above|` — an exact joint free body, not an
 * interpolation — and `criticalSection` already truncates the perimeter at a free edge.
 * Footings have driven both for several revisions.
 *
 * What did not exist was the COLLECTOR: at a slab–column joint the two axial forces are per
 * COMBINATION and live on the column element ends, and nothing assembled them. So every
 * column-supported panel reported its governing check as UNSUPPORTED while the engine that
 * could answer it sat one import away. This module is that collector.
 *
 * ── The free body, stated completely ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Cut a body out of the floor bounded by the critical perimeter at d/2 from the column
 * faces, and cut through the columns above and below. Vertical equilibrium gives
 *
 *     ΔN  =  V_u  +  F_direct  +  q_u · A_enclosed
 *
 * where
 *
 *   ΔN                the step in column axial force across the joint, compression positive:
 *                     everything delivered into the column at this level
 *   V_u               the two-way shear crossing the critical perimeter — the punching demand
 *   F_direct          load that reaches the column WITHOUT crossing the perimeter: the end
 *                     shears of beams framing into the joint, and any load applied at the
 *                     joint node itself
 *   q_u · A_enclosed  the surface load standing on the slab inside the perimeter
 *
 * Every term on the right is measured, so V_u is what is left. `F_direct` matters and is the
 * term a naive collector drops: at a joint where beams frame into the column, most of the
 * floor load arrives through the beams, and calling the whole axial step "punching" would
 * fail an ordinary beam-and-slab floor on a mechanism that is not carrying it. It is deducted
 * because it is KNOWN — the branch's rule is conservative where a quantity is unknown and
 * exact where it is measured, and beam end shears at a joint are measured.
 *
 * ── Why the residual is a gate and not a decoration ────────────────
 *
 * The identity above is what defines V_u here, so it closes to rounding BY CONSTRUCTION — and
 * that is exactly what makes its failure informative. It cannot close when the deductions
 * exceed the axial step, which is what a stale analysis, a missing column force or a joint
 * whose beams were solved against different loads all look like. In that case `V_u` would be
 * a negative number floored at zero: a passing punching check produced by arithmetic rather
 * than by capacity. So the residual is measured against its own denominator, and a joint that
 * cannot establish it returns UNSUPPORTED with the shortfall named, never a verified check.
 *
 * ── Position is measured from the slab around the joint ────────────
 *
 * α_s (§22.6.5.3) is tabulated for interior, edge and corner and for nothing else, so the
 * position cannot be assumed. It is measured as the total interior ANGLE of slab material
 * meeting the joint: 360° interior, 180° in one run edge, 90° corner. The angle — rather than
 * a count of adjoining elements — is what a meshed floor needs, where one joint can have two
 * neighbours or eight and still be the same interior joint.
 *
 * Two patterns are refused rather than approximated, and they are the same two the footing
 * path already refuses: 180° arriving as two OPPOSITE runs is a strip-like perimeter that is
 * none of the three tabulated cases, and 270° is a re-entrant corner whose perimeter is a
 * sixth shape again.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes, no i18n. Lengths m, forces kN, stresses MPa.
