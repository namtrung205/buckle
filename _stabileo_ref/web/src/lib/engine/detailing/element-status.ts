/**
 * What the app is actually able to say about each member, in one word.
 *
 * ── Why this is its own module ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two halves of the answer live in two places that must not be merged. The SCENE knows
 * whether a member has steel in it, and it knows that because it is a projection of the
 * document — it reads nothing else and must keep reading nothing else. The DESIGN RUN knows
 * whether the member was verified, refused, or never reached, and that lives on an outcome
 * the document does not carry.
 *
 * Joining them inside the scene would make the projection depend on live design state.
 * Joining them inside a Svelte component would make the rule untestable and would let two
 * screens answer the same question differently. So the join happens here: pure, given both
 * halves explicitly, returning one status per element.
 *
 * ── Why "has steel" is not the whole answer ────────────────────────
 *
 * Because "no steel" has at least four different causes and they need different actions:
 *
 *   - the design was refused              → change the section, or design by hand
 *   - a required check is not implemented → nothing you do to the section will help
 *   - the member was never evaluated      → run the design
 *   - the member was designed but has no
 *     modellable geometry (a wall with no
 *     start/end, whose checks are real
 *     and whose bar schedule cannot exist) → supply the geometry
 *
 * A view that collapses those into "grey" is a view that cannot be acted on, and one that
 * omits them — which is what this app did before — is worse.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes, no i18n, no DOM.

 * the verifier does not implement the biaxial check, and every one of those beams carries
 * real bending about both axes. The workspace already held that sentence — but only per
 * member, and only while that member was selected. So the screen said "UNSUPPORTED 117",
 * which reads as 117 separate problems, or as a broken viewer, and the user's next move was
 * to click 117 members to find out it was one problem all along.
 *
 * The distinction this makes possible is the one the whole investigation turned on: a
 * legitimate, uniform limitation of the biaxial design path is a very different report from
 * 117 members whose steel went missing somewhere between the design and the screen. Stating
 * the shared cause and the span of ratios behind it is what lets a reviewer tell them apart
