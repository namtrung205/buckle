/**
 * The production path from a modelled footing to a checked, detailed footing.
 *
 * To foundations what `run-floor-design.ts` is to slabs and walls: it reads what the model
 * and the solver already hold, and calls `checkFooting` — which has been complete and
 * unit-tested since PR18 opened with no caller outside its own tests.
 *
 * ── What the demand is made of ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Strength checks (one-way shear, punching, flexure) take the GOVERNING strength
 * combination's reaction: real per-combination solver output, chosen by the largest
 * vertical, with the combination named in the result so the certificate can state it.
 *
 * Bearing is a SERVICE-level comparison (§13.3.1), and the app has no service-combination
 * concept — every stored combination is a strength combination. So the service reaction is
 * summed from the PER-CASE reactions at unit factors, over gravity cases only, and that
 * choice is reported as an assumption rather than applied silently. Wind and seismic cases
 * are excluded, because a service wind combination has its own factors that this project
 * does not model; a footing whose bearing would be governed by them says so instead of
 * being checked against an incomplete sum. With no per-case results at all, bearing is
 * UNSUPPORTED — it is not approximated from the factored reaction by dividing by a guessed
 * 1,4.
 *
 * ── The gate ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A footing cannot be reported as verified without its inputs. Missing soil, missing
 * reaction, invalid geometry and an unsupported footing kind each produce an outcome with
 * `check: null` and a named reason. `checkFooting` itself already rolls any unsupported
 * constituent up to UNSUPPORTED, so a footing whose punching could not be checked never
 * reads as OK.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes. Forces kN, moments kN·m, lengths m, pressures kPa.
