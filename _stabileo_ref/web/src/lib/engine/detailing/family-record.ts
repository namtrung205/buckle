/**
 * The authoritative floor-family design record — the persisted evidence of a real design.
 *
 * ── What was wrong, precisely ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PR18 shipped complete slab, wall and footing ENGINES with a production adapter, and the
 * results lived in `$state` (`lastFloorRun`, `lastFootingRun`). They died on reload. A user
 * could design a floor, close the tab, reopen the project and find the bars still there —
 * persisted on the assembly — with no record of the demands, combinations, ground profile or
 * checks that sized them. The steel outlived its own justification.
 *
 * That is worse than losing both. Bars with no evidence behind them read as a design, and
 * nothing in the app could tell you they were not one.
 *
 * ── What this is, and what it is deliberately not ──────────────────
 *
 * It is ONE immutable, revision-bound record per designed family member, persisted on the
 * same `DetailingAssembly` as the steel it justifies. It carries enough to:
 *
 *   · reconstruct the design result after reload — no transient UI state required;
 *   · verify certificate-to-input agreement, by hash rather than by inspection;
 *   · build the current documents, by projection rather than by recalculation;
 *   · retain superseded documents, because the record they were built from is still here;
 *   · explain the governing demands and the assumptions behind them;
 *   · project physical reinforcement and quantities.
 *
 * It is NOT a second calculation engine. Nothing here computes a demand, a capacity or a
 * bar. Every number is copied from the engine that owns it, and the discriminated union
 * exists so a consumer cannot read a slab field off a footing.
 *
 * It is NOT a document DTO either. A document is a projection OF this; this is the thing
 * that survives, and the document can be rebuilt from it at a later revision.
 *
 * ── Prose is not data ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every human-facing string is an `EngineMessage`. The engines below `codes/` already obey
 * that rule; the records must too, because they reach certificates, reports, drawings and
 * spreadsheets, each with its own locale and its own space budget. A record that stored a
 * Spanish sentence would be a record that cannot be issued in English.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes, no i18n, no clock.
