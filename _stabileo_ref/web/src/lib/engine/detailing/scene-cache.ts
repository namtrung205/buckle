/**
 * Build the scene once per document, not once per reactive touch.
 *
 * ── The 2,4 seconds this exists to remove ──────────────────────────
 *
 * `buildSceneModel` samples 20 917 bars with `samplePath` on the 7-storey building. That is
 * the expensive step, and it was being repeated for reasons that had nothing to do with the
 * steel: `membersFromModel` returns a fresh array on every call, so the `$derived` that feeds
 * the scene saw a new input whenever anything in the workspace changed — a checkbox, an
 * opacity slider, a selection — and rebuilt the whole projection.
 *
 * Returning from another browser tab was the worst case, because Svelte flushes every pending
 * effect at once and the user waited ~2,4 s with a dead panel.
 *
 * The cache asks the only question that matters: is this the same document, projected over the
 * same members. Both halves are needed. Keying on the document alone would serve a stale scene
 * after a section edit; keying on the members alone would serve one after a re-design.
 *
 * ── Why one entry and not an LRU ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A workspace shows one document. A second entry would hold a second copy of 20 917 sampled
 * polylines alive for a document nobody is looking at, which is the memory this is meant to
 * stop spending. Switching documents evicts.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes. The staleness question is answered by the inputs, never by a
 * timer or a manual invalidation someone can forget to call.
