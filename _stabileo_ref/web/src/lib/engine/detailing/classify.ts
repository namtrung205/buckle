/**
 * Classify what a bar pair actually IS before deciding whether it is a problem.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The collision detector asked one question of every pair — "are these two bars at least
 * X apart?" — with a single X supplied by the caller. On the 408-member flagship that
 * produced ~11,000 conflicts, and inspection showed most of them were not conflicts:
 *
 *   * Every longitudinal-to-longitudinal pair was measured against the COLUMN rule
 *     (§25.2.3: max(40 mm, 1.5 db, 4/3 d_agg)), because the caller selected `beam` only
 *     when one of the bars was transverse — and stirrups are not emitted as bar paths at
 *     all. Beam bars were being held to 40 mm where §25.2.1 asks for 25 mm.
 *
 *   * Bars in different LAYERS of the same face were measured against the in-layer rule
 *     instead of §25.2.2's 25 mm between layers, so a correctly detailed two-layer group
 *     reported a violation.
 *
 *   * A beam bar crossing a column bar at ninety degrees was measured as though the two
 *     had to stand apart. They do not: crossing bars touch and are tied. What matters
 *     there is whether they physically interpenetrate.
 *
 * So the pair is classified first, and the class decides both the rule and whether a
 * shortfall is a defect at all. Required containment — a tie around the bars it confines —
 * is never a collision. Prohibited overlap is never explained away by tolerance.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes, no i18n.

   * bars and §25.2.3 is what governs them, which is why `buildFloorAssembly` declares a
   * footing's elements as columns. The bottom MAT shares that element id and answers to a

   * routes minimum spacing to §25.2, and §25.2.1 is the in-layer rule — `max(25 mm, d_b,
   * 4/3 d_agg)` — not §25.2.3's `max(40 mm, 1,5 d_b, 4/3 d_agg)`.

 * ── Order matters, and it changed ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Interpenetration is now tested FIRST and is unconditional. The previous order tested the
 * contact relationships first, on the reasoning that "checking overlap first classifies
 * every tie point as a prohibited overlap, because bars that are tied together do touch."
 * That reasoning does not survive the definition: contact means `surfaceClearance ≈ 0`, and
 * `CONTACT_ALLOWANCE` already puts a 2 mm moat around it. Interpenetration means the
 * surfaces are driven THROUGH each other, which is not what tying looks like.
 *
 * What the old order actually bought was an exemption for the impossible. Rule 1 read
 * `role === 'transverse' && sharesMember(a, b)` → `requiredContainment`, reportable: false —
 * no geometry consulted, no relationship consulted. A stirrup driven straight through a
 * longitudinal bar, surfaces interpenetrating by a full diameter, was classified as required
 * containment and dropped from the conflict list before anything could measure it. Every
 * transverse-to-longitudinal pair in a member was exempt from every check.
 *
 * So containment now has to be EARNED, and it is three separate conditions:
 *
 *   1. a DECLARED relationship — the generator recorded that this piece encloses, restrains
 *      or hooks around this specific bar (`enclosesBarIds` / `restrainsBarIds` /
 *      `hookContactsBarIds`), by id, not by role;
 *   2. SHARED OWNERSHIP — a stirrup in one beam has no business containing another member's
 *      steel, and at a joint the two cages genuinely are unrelated;
 *   3. VALID GEOMETRY — the surfaces do not interpenetrate. This one is unconditional and
 *      is why it is tested first: a declared relationship is a statement of intent, and
 *      intent does not make two solids occupy one space.
 *
 * A transverse-to-longitudinal pair that is NOT in a declared relationship is no longer
 * waved past. It falls through to the crossing and spacing rules like any other pair, which
 * is the correct treatment: a stirrup passing a bar it does not hold is exactly the crossing
