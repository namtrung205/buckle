/**
 * ── REBASELINED when Table 9.7.6.2.2 was implemented in full ──────
 *
 * This block used to be titled "beams 7 and 8" and asserted that exactly two members
 * failed at their final geometry. Four do. The extra two are not a regression; they are the
 * defect the old rule hid.
 *
 * `maxStirrupSpacing` had a branch `if (VsReq <= 0) return min(0,8·d, 300 mm)`. Table
 * 9.7.6.2.2 is indexed on "V_s **requerido**", so a required V_s of zero is row 1 and the
 * limit is the lesser of d/2 and 400 mm — never `0,8·d`. In the SPAN region of members 5, 6,
 * 7 and 8 the required V_s is zero, so all four span regions were being checked against an
 * invented 300 mm limit instead of the table's d/2. At the final geometry d/2 is 248 mm
 * (members 5 and 6) or 242 mm (7 and 8), and 250 mm was provided.
 *
 * So the previous baseline certified a 250 mm span spacing that the regulation forbids, on
 * four members. That is the false pass F6 predicted, now measured on the production path.
 *
 * The two pairs differ in HOW MUCH depth they lose, which is why they fail by different
 * amounts and repair to different utilizations:
 *   5, 6 — no joint-layer movement, only Table 26.6.2.1(a)'s 15 mm → d = 497, d/2 = 248,5
 *   7, 8 — 12 mm bottom raise + 10 mm top drop + 15 mm            → d = 485, d/2 = 242,5
