/**
 * Transverse coverage across the fixture set — the measurement, not a sample of it.
 *
 * ── Why every fixture and not just the one that was being fixed ─────
 *
 * Each defect in this branch was found on one fixture and was present on all of them. The
 * stirrup-bend restraint was measured on qa-8 and broke the feasible frame the same way; the
 * crosstie shaft ran through its peripheral bars everywhere but only row-2 has crossties to
 * show it. A per-fixture table is the cheapest way to stop that pattern repeating.
 *
 * What is asserted is an INVARIANT, not a number. Counts are logged so a change is visible in
 * the diff, but a test that pins "704 bends" fails when a fixture legitimately grows and tells
 * you nothing about whether the cage is right.
