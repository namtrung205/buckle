/**
 * The 408/373 discrepancy — what the outcome population actually is.
 *
 * A live run on the 408-member flagship reported "408 members, 373 verified". "373" is a
 * DISPLAY BAND (utilisation below a threshold), not an outcome split. If detailing keyed off
 * the band rather than the outcome it would silently drop fully compliant members, which is
 * the confusion these two assertions exist to prevent.
 *
 * ── Recalibrated 408 → 386 by the PR78 review fixes ────────────
 *
 * This file used to assert 408/408 VERIFIED and an empty non-VERIFIED population, which was
 * true when it was written. The biaxial column-axis mapping and biaxial-beam refusal that
 * arrived with the merged PR15 changed the honest answer to 386 VERIFIED and 22
 * refusals — the fixture's BEAM-Y members, whose secondary Mz/Vy demand crosses the
 * 10% biaxial threshold on an axis this verifier never checks for beams. Before the fix they
 * were certified having never been checked; the 22 refusals are the correction, not a
 * regression, and `autodesign-regression.test.ts` is the gate that owns those numbers.
 *
 * So the assertion below is no longer "nothing is refused". It is the sharper claim the file
 * was always making: the members detailing works on are exactly the members that hold a
 * VERIFIED outcome, and anything excluded is excluded on OUTCOME grounds — never because it
 * sat in a low-utilisation display band.
 *
 * Split from the coverage-invariant suite because these two assertions need only the SOLVE and
 * DESIGN steps. Keeping them beside the detailing invariants meant every run of this concern
 * also paid for the detailing ones.
