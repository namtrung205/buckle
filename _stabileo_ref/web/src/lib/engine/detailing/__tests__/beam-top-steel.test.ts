 * This file asserts the RULE, one condition at a time, so that when the building test fails it
 * is possible to tell which condition moved.
 *
 * The clauses, and precisely what each does and does not fix, are in the header of

 *
 *   the COUNT is two and comes from the regulation;
 *   the DIAMETER comes from nowhere in the regulation, and every bar carrying one says so.
