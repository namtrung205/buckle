/**
 * The physical transverse cage, measured on the production path.
 *
 * ── Why these assertions and not others ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every one of these was a real defect found by running the fixture and reading the geometry,
 * not by reasoning about the code. They are kept because each of them was invisible to unit
 * tests: the pieces were individually correct and the assembly was not.
 *
 * The history, in the order the measurements came out:
 *
 *   177 prohibited conflicts   the cage appended to the assembly for the first time
 *   → 158   `samplePath` interpolated arcs LINEARLY between endpoints, so every bend was
 *           collision-checked as its chord. Twelve millimetres of steel in the wrong place on
 *           a 135° hook — more than the diameter of the bars it was checked against.
 *   → 18    corner bars were seated at `(d_s + d_b)/2`, the contact distance from a STRAIGHT
 *           leg, which puts them inside the corner bend; and the closing hook was a straight
 *           diagonal √2 too long, driven through the second layer.
 *   → 0     beam stirrups ran to the node — the column centreline — so both beams at a joint
 *           put a stirrup in the joint volume.
 *
 * Then the joint ties went in, and the same defects surfaced in the column:
 *
 *   22 → 8  three more modules had each re-derived the bar-seating rectangle, two of them
 *           wrongly. They now read one function.
 *   → 0     the collision sampler's 5 mm chord tolerance turned a designed contact into a
 *           3,17 mm interpenetration, eight times over.
