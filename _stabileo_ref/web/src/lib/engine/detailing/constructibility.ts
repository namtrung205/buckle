/**
 * The CONSTRUCTIBLE gate.
 *
 * ── What went wrong ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The coordination search reported `CONSTRUCTIBLE` when it found a complete assignment.
 * On the flagship that label sat on top of 7,246 prohibited physical overlaps, no
 * re-verification after the geometry moved, no placement-robustness check, and no
 * consumption of the lap geometry by anything downstream.
 *
 * The search was not lying about what it knew. It reasons about joint threading and
 * collinear transitions, it found an assignment, and that is a real result. The defect was
 * that "an assignment exists" and "this can be built" were the same word. They are
 * different claims with different evidence and different consequences: the first is an
 * intermediate search outcome, the second is a statement to an engineer who will pour
 * concrete against it.
 *
 * So the search now says `ASSIGNMENT_FOUND`, and constructibility is decided HERE, on the
 * materialised geometry, against thirteen conditions that must ALL hold.
 *
 * ── Why it is data, not a boolean ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every condition is reported with its own evidence, whether it passed or failed. A gate
 * that returns false and nothing else is a gate nobody can argue with, and the engineer
 * has to be able to see which of the thirteen is blocking and by how much. A single failing
 * condition is enough to withhold the claim — and it must be NAMED, not summarised.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes, no i18n.

/**
 * The fifteen conditions, in the order they are evaluated and reported.
 *
 * The thirteenth — `allRequiredTransversePathsMaterialised` — was added when the transverse
 * cage became physical. Without it the gate had no way to tell a floor whose stirrups exist
 * from one whose stirrups are still an instruction, and CONSTRUCTIBLE was reachable with no
 * shear steel in the model at all.
 *
 * The fourteenth and fifteenth were added when slabs, walls and footings gained real design
 * records. Before them the gate had exactly ONE certificate instrument —
 * `certificatesMatchGeometry`, counted over FRAME members — so a slab-only floor faced a
 * choice between two wrong answers: leave `reverifiedMembers` at zero and never reach
 * CONSTRUCTIBLE however complete the design, or set the frame flags true and satisfy two
 * conditions that nothing measured. The second is the false-completeness this whole gate
 * exists to prevent, and it is now impossible to express: the frame conditions count frame
 * members, the family conditions count family members, and each is measured against what is
 * APPLICABLE rather than against a flag a caller could set.
