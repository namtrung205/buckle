/**
 * The DocumentModel: one assembled, self-consistent description of what is being issued.
 *
 * ── Why a model rather than three exporters ────────────────────────
 *
 * A PDF, a DXF and an XLSX of the same floor are three renderings of ONE statement about
 * the structure. Built independently they drift: the schedule totals bars the drawing does
 * not show, the report quotes a revision the drawing predates, and nobody can tell which is
 * wrong. The failure is silent and it is discovered on site.
 *
 * So the document is assembled ONCE — regulations, revisions, certificates, physical
 * assemblies, layers, fusions, laps, transitions, conflicts, review state, maturity — and
 * the three outputs are projections of it. Anything absent from the model cannot appear in
 * an output, and anything in the model appears in all of them consistently.
 *
 * ── Readiness is part of the document, not a footnote ──────────────
 *
 * A conflicted floor can still be documented. Engineers need drawings to discuss a problem
 * long before it is solved, and refusing to produce them is not caution, it is
 * obstruction. What must never happen is a conflicted floor producing a document that
 * looks issued.
 *
 * So every document carries a `readiness`, and a document that is not CONSTRUCTIBLE is a
 * REVIEW DRAFT: it lists its unresolved conflicts on the face of the first sheet, it is
 * watermarked, and it makes no construction claim. That is a different artefact from an
 * issued drawing, and it says so.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes, no i18n, no file system.
