/**
 * Which members of this model are metallic, and what the app is entitled to say about each.
 *
 * ── What this is for ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Today the answer to "what steel is in my model?" is: nothing asks. The RC design table
 * lists every element, including the steel ones, and refuses them under
 * `DEMAND_UNAVAILABLE` — the same bucket as "you have not solved yet" — with the real
 * reason, `notConcrete`, third in a list. The CIRSOC 301 table in the verification tab
 * lists them under a green tick with no authority behind it. Neither is an inventory and
 * neither is honest.
 *
 * This is the inventory. It states what is metallic, why it thinks so, and what has and has
 * not been done to it. It computes no capacity and asserts no verification, because there
 * is no metallic authority in this app to do either.
 *
 * ── The census exists so an empty answer is still an answer ────────
 *
 * "No metallic members" and "this model has 400 members and none of them are metallic" and
 * "this model is entirely metallic but nothing has a strength recorded" are three different
 * situations, and a panel that renders the first for all three sends the user looking for a
 * bug. So the census counts every element by family, and the empty state reads off it.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes, no i18n.

 * free to disagree with the first. Importing across the boundary is the lesser evil, and
