/**
 * Built-up sections: two or four rolled profiles working as one member.
 *
 * ── What this replaces ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The industrial-building example in this repository carries its double angles like this:
 *
 *   { "name": "Col cord 2L75", "a": 0.00114, "iz": 4.5e-7, "iy": 4.5e-7,
 *     "shape": "L", "h": 0.075, "b": 0.075, "t": 0.006 }
 *
 * A `shape: "L"` with the area of ONE angle and the name of two. The composition lives in
 * the name and nowhere else, the inertias are a single angle's, and the parallel-axis term
 * — which for a back-to-back pair is most of the weak-axis stiffness — is simply absent.
 * A generator that emits "Doble ][" has to emit real properties, not a naming convention.
 *
 * ── How the properties are obtained ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * By the parallel-axis theorem on the single profile's own centroidal properties. This is
 * EXACT — not an approximation — and it needs nothing the catalogue does not already have
 * once the profile is resolved to canonical geometry:
 *
 *   A   = Σ Aᵢ
 *   Iy  = Σ (Iyᵢ + Aᵢ·(zᵢ − z̄)²)
 *   Iz  = Σ (Izᵢ + Aᵢ·(yᵢ − ȳ)²)
 *   Iyz = Σ (sᵢ·Iyzᵢ + Aᵢ·(yᵢ − ȳ)(zᵢ − z̄))
 *
 * `sᵢ` is −1 for a copy mirrored about exactly one axis and +1 otherwise: a reflection
 * reverses the sign of the product of inertia and leaves the second moments alone. That
 * term is zero for doubly-symmetric profiles and is the whole point for angles, where
 * Iyz ≠ 0 and getting its sign wrong rotates the principal axes the wrong way.
 *
 * The alternative — integrating a composed polygon — was rejected. `buildSectionGeometry`
 * accepts `kind: 'custom'` with one outer ring plus holes, and two profiles separated by a
 * gap are two DISJOINT regions, which that contract cannot express. Parallel axis gives
 * the identical answer without a WASM change, and a round-trip test (compose n = 1, get
 * the single profile back to machine precision) pins that it does.
 *
 * ── Torsion is NOT summed for a closed arrangement ─────────────────
 *
 * For an open built-up member with no continuous connection between the parts — the
 * back-to-back and parallel families below — the standard treatment is J ≈ Σ Jᵢ, and that
 * is what this module reports, as a DECLARED ASSUMPTION rather than as a fact.
 *
 * For a closed arrangement — two channels toe-to-toe, four angles boxed — that sum is
 * wrong by orders of magnitude: the cell carries a Bredt shear flow and its torsional
 * constant is 4·Am²/∮(ds/t), which has nothing to do with the sum of the open parts.
 * Computing Am correctly needs the cell's mid-line, which depends on which walls of which
 * profile bound it, and the catalogue does not carry enough to determine that for every
 * family. So a closed arrangement reports `j: null` with an explicit reason.
 *
 * That is not a dead end. `solverProperties` already returns `j: null` with
 * `jProvenance: 'unavailable'`, and `buildSolverInput3D` substitutes `Iy·0.001` — a
 * fabrication it labels as one — so the model still solves, torsionally soft. Soft is the
 * visible, conservative-for-this-member direction, and the assumption is recorded on the
 * generated model rather than discovered later. Inventing a number instead would not be.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes, no i18n, no WASM. Everything arrives in `SingleProfile`.
