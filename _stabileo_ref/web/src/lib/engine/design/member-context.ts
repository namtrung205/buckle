 * ── Why non-concrete members are left out rather than blocked ──────
 *
 * They used to be included. A steel frame therefore appeared, member by member, in the RC
 * design table; it was refused rather than designed, so no certificate was ever issued —
 * but it was counted. `verificationStore.providedSummary` walks these contexts, so a hall
 * with two concrete columns and three hundred steel members reported "2 verified of 302",
 * and the reason shown against each steel row was "demand unavailable" for members whose
 * demand was sitting right there.
 *
 * Blocking them instead of omitting them would fix the label and keep the pollution. They
 * are not members this pipeline refused; they are members it was never asked about. The
 * metallic surface lists them, with a census that says how many there are — see
 * `steel/steel-inventory.ts` — so nothing disappears, it just stops being counted as
 * concrete that failed.
 *
 * `unknown` is the exception that stays: a member whose material is missing or
 * unclassifiable is not metallic, it is unfinished input. Omitting it would make "you
 * forgot to set a material" indistinguishable from "this member does not exist", so it
 * keeps its context and reaches the table blocked on `missingMaterial` — a visible row
 * the user can act on, exactly as before the metallic exclusion existed.
