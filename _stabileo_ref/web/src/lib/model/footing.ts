/**
 * Isolated spread footings, as a first-class modelled entity.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `foundation-check.ts` has been complete and unit-tested since PR18 opened, and no user
 * could reach it, because the model carried nothing to check. There were no plan
 * dimensions, no thickness and no soil anywhere in `StructureModel`. The two ways out of
 * that were both wrong:
 *
 *   * infer a footing under every support from the reaction — that produces numbers with
 *     the appearance of a design for a foundation nobody dimensioned;
 *   * take the dimensions from a transient dialog at run time — that produces a
 *     verification that cannot be reopened, re-run, revised or drawn.
 *
 * So a footing is a persisted entity with an identity, like a node or a shell. It survives
 * save/open, undo, tab switch and URL share, it can be selected and deleted, and it carries
 * the revision metadata that lets its design go stale when it is edited.
 *
 * ── The division of ownership ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * GEOMETRY and materials live here. The GROUND lives in `geotechnical.ts` and is
 * referenced by id, because a bearing pressure is a property of a stratum shared by many
 * footings rather than of one footing. This split is the reason the Design tab can
 * summarise both and own neither.
 *
 * ── No invented defaults for anything that decides an outcome ───
 *
 * A new footing gets a geometry that is a starting point (0,50 m thickness and no plan
 * dimensions is not a design), and it gets NO soil. `B` and `L` start at zero, which fails
 * validation loudly, rather than at a plausible 1,50 m that would pass a bearing check the
 * engineer never made. Cover follows the project's own detailing default because it is a
 * detailing convention rather than a strength decision.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no runes. Lengths m, strengths MPa, angles degrees.
