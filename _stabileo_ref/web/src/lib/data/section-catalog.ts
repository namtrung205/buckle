/**
 * section-catalog.ts — how the profile catalogue is organised for picking.
 *
 * # The distinction this file exists to keep straight
 *
 * A **design code** (CIRSOC 301, Eurocode 3, AISC 360) does not define
 * profiles. It defines how you verify a member. The *dimensions* come from a
 * separate **dimensional standard** (DIN 1025-1, EN 10365, IRAM-IAS U 500-42,
 * ASTM A6). One design code references several dimensional standards, and one
 * dimensional standard is referenced by several design codes.
 *
 * Collapsing the two — labelling a family "CIRSOC" — is what makes a catalogue
 * impossible to extend later, because the day you add a second code you
 * discover the families were never owned by the first one. So families here
 * carry the dimensional standard their numbers actually came from, which is
 * checkable, and design codes are a separate index built on top.
 *
 * # What the standards below are, and what backs them
 *
 * Every dimensional standard named here was verified numerically, not asserted:
 * the canonical outline is built from it and integrated, and the result must
 * reproduce the published area and inertias. See
 * `engine/src/section/catalogue.rs` and the header of `steel-profiles.ts`.
