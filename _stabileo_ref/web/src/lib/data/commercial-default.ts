/**
 * commercial-default.ts — the steel a section arrives in.
 *
 * # What this decides
 *
 * Picking a profile from the catalogue says what SHAPE a member is. It also
 * says something about the steel, because a mill rolls each family in a
 * particular grade — an IPN comes in F-24 the way a W comes in A992 — and a
 * model whose sections are catalogue profiles but whose material is whatever
 * was lying around is describing a member nobody would order.
 *
 * So choosing a profile can carry its grade along with it. The whole question
 * is when that is help and when it is interference.
 *
 * # The rule, and why this one
 *
 * The grade is applied ONLY when the element's current material did not come
 * from the catalogue — when nobody has chosen a steel on purpose yet.
 *
 * The alternative, applying it always, would silently overwrite a deliberate
 * choice: an engineer verifying an existing structure sets the steel FIRST,
 * because that is the fact they are given, and then tries sections against it.
 * Overwriting that on every section change would be actively destructive, and
 * quietly, since the section is what they were looking at.
 *
 * Doing nothing at all — which is what happened until now, because this
 * mechanism was written and never wired up — leaves every new frame with
 * profiles from a mill catalogue and a generic steel underneath.
 *
 * # What it never does
 *
 * It never edits an existing material. Materials are SHARED between elements,
 * so changing one to suit the member you happen to be editing would change
 * every other member made of it. Applying a grade means pointing this element
 * at a different material, and creating that material if the model has none.
