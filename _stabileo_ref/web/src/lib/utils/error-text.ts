/**
 * The readable text of a thrown value.
 *
 * Written for the shape the engine throws. Every `#[wasm_bindgen]` export in
 * `engine/src/lib.rs` returns `Result<String, JsValue>` and builds its error with
 * `JsValue::from_str` — 76 exports, 216 such sites. wasm-bindgen throws that value
 * as-is, so a `catch` receives a JS STRING PRIMITIVE rather than an `Error`, and a
 * string has no `.message`.
 *
 * `e.message ?? fallback` therefore reports the fallback for every refusal the
 * solver writes, which is how "Guyan reduction does not support prescribed support
 * displacements (node 3)" reached the user as "Model Reduction: Error". The string
 * branch is checked FIRST because it is the case that actually occurs.
 *
 * A non-string, non-Error value returns the fallback rather than `String(value)`:
 * stringifying `42` or `[object Object]` into an error panel presents noise as if
 * it were the engine's explanation.
