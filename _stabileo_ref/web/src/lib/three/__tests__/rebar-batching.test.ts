/**
 * A layer switch must not rebuild the building.
 *
 * ── What went wrong ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Bars were merged into one buffer per COLOUR, so "hide columns" could only be expressed by
 * handing the renderer a smaller scene — and a smaller scene has a different signature, so all
 * 20 917 tubes were re-sampled, re-framed and re-emitted to answer a checkbox. Measured on the
 * 7-storey building: 5,9 s for the first columns toggle and up to 16,7 s for slabs, to arrive at
 * geometry already sitting on the GPU.
 *
 * Batching by family AND colour makes a family switch `mesh.visible`. The filters that cut ACROSS
 * a family — isolate this member, show only these states — compact the index instead, which
 * re-selects which of the already-built triangles are drawn and rebuilds no tube either.
 *
 * ── Why this file measures as well as asserts ───────────────────────
 *
 * Because "does not rebuild" is a claim about cost, and a cost nobody timed is a hope. So the
 * numbers are printed for the record — including the old rebuild-to-toggle path, measured in the
 * same run on the same machine, because a remembered figure from another session is not a
 * comparison.
 *
 * What is ASSERTED is not a timing. It is the build counter and the identity of the vertex
 * buffers: a switch may not build a tube and may not so much as re-upload one. Those cannot be
 * explained away by a busy machine, which is what a millisecond threshold inside a 262-file
 * parallel suite always can be. The timings carry ceilings too, wide enough to survive
 * contention and narrow enough to catch an order-of-magnitude return.
 *
 * ── Why the picking assertions are as long as they are ─────────────
 *
 * A picking map off by one bar does not look wrong. It returns the neighbouring bar's mark, and
 * a user reading a mark off the screen has no way to know. Frame elements and shell elements are
 * numbered independently and both start at 1, so a slab bar and a column bar can carry the same
 * number — 11 340 slab bars and 234 wall bars were once counted as column steel through exactly
 * that collision. Splitting the merge into more meshes is a new chance to reintroduce it, so
 * every batch's first and last triangle is checked, filtered and unfiltered.

 * COUNTER and by the identity of the vertex buffers, not by a stopwatch. Those cannot be explained
 * away by a busy machine, and they are what the `nothing rebuilds a tube` block above and the
 * browser benchmark both check.
 *
 * These numbers exist to catch an order-of-magnitude change and nothing finer, because this file
 * runs inside a 262-file parallel suite: the same status filter measured 5,6 ms alone and 26,8 ms
 * with the whole suite competing for the machine. A threshold tuned to the quiet number fails on
 * the busy one and teaches everyone to ignore it.
 *
 * The two classes differ because the mechanisms differ. A family switch is a flag on a handful of
 * meshes and is genuinely O(batches). An isolate or a status filter cuts across batches, so it
 * compacts each one's index — a typed-array copy over every drawn triangle, which scales with the
 * model exactly as a rebuild does, and is legitimately a few percent of one.
