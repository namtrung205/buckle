/**
 * The reinforcement, as geometry you can orbit.
 *
 * ── What this module is and is not ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is a renderer. It takes a `SceneModel` — already projected from the document, already
 * sampled, already carrying its marks — and turns it into Three.js objects. It decides
 * colours, tube radii and draw-call batching, and it decides nothing else. No bar position,
 * no clearance, no length. If a number appears on screen it came from the document.
 *
 * That division is why the scene model is a separate, pure module: everything worth testing
 * about WHAT is shown is testable without WebGL, and this file only has to be right about
 * how it looks.
 *
 * ── Why the tubes are built by hand ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `THREE.TubeGeometry` re-samples its curve at equal arc length. Handed a bar polyline it
 * would place its rings wherever it liked, which on a 135° stirrup hook — five sample points
 * inside 25 mm — means the hook is smoothed away or missed. The bars in this model were
 * sampled by `samplePath` at a chord tolerance chosen so the collision checker measures the
 * real bend; re-sampling them here would throw that away and, worse, would make the picture
 * disagree with the check.
 *
 * So the tube walks the polyline's own vertices, one ring per vertex, with a parallel
 * transport frame. Parallel transport rather than a Frenet frame because a Frenet frame flips
 * its normal through an inflection and spins wildly where curvature vanishes — which is most
 * of a reinforcing bar, since a straight run has no defined normal at all.
 *
 * ── Why the geometry is merged ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A floor is thousands of bars. One mesh per bar is thousands of draw calls and a viewport
 * that stutters before the model is interesting. Bars are merged into one buffer per colour
 * category, and the mapping from a picked triangle back to its bar is kept alongside — so
 * the batching stays invisible to the user, who can still click a stirrup and be told which
 * mark it is.
 *
 * ── Why the merge is ALSO split by family ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Because a colour is not a switch. Batched by colour alone, every column bar and every slab
 * bar sat in the same buffer, so "hide columns" could only be expressed by handing the renderer
 * a smaller scene — which meant re-tubing all 20 917 bars to answer a checkbox. Measured on the
 * 7-storey building: 5,9 s for the first columns toggle and up to 16,7 s for slabs, to arrive at
 * a picture whose visible geometry was already on the GPU.
 *
 * So a batch is one family AND one colour, and a family switch is `mesh.visible`. Nothing is
 * sampled, no buffer is allocated, no index is recomputed and no picking map is rebuilt.
 *
 * The filters that are NOT family-shaped — isolate this member, show only these states — cannot
 * be a visibility flag, because they cut ACROSS a batch. They are answered by re-selecting which
 * of the batch's already-built triangles are drawn: the index is compacted from a master copy
 * that never changes, and the positions and normals are never touched. That is the honest
 * distinction, and it is why this file has two mechanisms rather than one.

 * How round a conflict marker is.
 *
 * ── Why these numbers, and why they are a named constant ───────────
 *
 * A marker is a DOT. What it has to communicate is where the conflict is and how bad it is, and
 * the second of those is carried by the marker's SIZE — scaled by the shortfall, floored so a 2 mm
 * one is still visible. Its roundness communicates nothing.
 *
 * At 10 × 8 a marker was 140 triangles. The 7-storey building carries 39 240 open conflicts, so the
 * markers alone were 5 493 600 triangles — five and a half times the 1 008 672 the entire
 * reinforcement needs. 6 × 4 is 36 triangles and 1 412 640 in total: the same position, the same
 * radius, the same colour, the same instance matrix, 3,89× less geometry. It reads as a faceted bead
 * at the size a marker is viewed rather than as a smooth ball, which is a fair description of what
 * it is.
 *
 * ── What that bought, measured, and what it did not ────────────────
 *
 * A family switch with the markers on screen, median of three on the E2E runner's software
 * rasteriser:
 *
 *     hide columns   5 412 ms → 2 611 ms
 *     show columns   4 934 ms → 2 610 ms
 *
 * About 1,9×, against 3,89× less geometry — so the triangles were not the whole cost. The rest is
 * fill rate: 39 240 translucent spheres cover the same screen area however few triangles each is
 * made of, and blending them is per-fragment work no tessellation change can reach. Switching the
 * markers themselves is too noisy on this runner to quote a factor for; the benchmark prints its
 * raw samples rather than a conclusion.
 *
 * Named rather than inlined so the benchmark can report what it measured against, and so a future
 * change to it is a change to a documented decision rather than to two digits in a constructor.

 * Because the renderer now holds the WHOLE model and answers the layer switches with visibility,
