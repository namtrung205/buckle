/**
 * Physical reinforcing-bar geometry — CIRSOC 201-2025 Chapter 25.
 *
 * The app has, until now, described reinforcement as counts and diameters: "5Ø20 bottom
 * span". That is enough to verify a section and nowhere near enough to draw one, order
 * one or check that it fits. A bar on site is a polyline with bends of a specific
 * radius, hooks with specific extensions, and a cutting length that is neither the span
 * nor the sum of its legs.
 *
 * This module is the headless geometric truth. It produces `BarPath` objects in model
 * coordinates, with no rendering, no store and no Three.js — the viewport consumes it
 * for display, the DXF writer for output, the collision engine for clash detection and
 * the schedule for cutting lengths. One representation, four consumers, so a bar that
 * is drawn is by construction the same bar that was checked and scheduled.
 *
 * ── Normative geometry, verbatim ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Table 25.3.1 — standard hooks for anchoring deformed bars in tension:
 *   90° hook   Ø10–25 → mandrel 6d_b, straight extension 12d_b
 *              Ø32    → mandrel 8d_b
 *              Ø40+   → mandrel 10d_b
 *   180° hook  Ø10–25 → mandrel 6d_b, straight extension max(4d_b, 65 mm)
 *              Ø32    → mandrel 8d_b
 *              Ø40+   → mandrel 10d_b
 *
 * Table 25.3.2 — minimum bend diameters and hook geometry for stirrups and ties:
 *   90° hook   Ø10–16 → mandrel 4d_be, extension max(6d_be, 75 mm)
 *              Ø20–25 → mandrel 6d_be, extension 12d_be
 *   135° hook  Ø10–16 → mandrel 4d_be, extension max(6d_be, 75 mm)
 *              Ø20–25 → mandrel 6d_be
 *   180° hook  Ø10–16 → mandrel 4d_be
 *              Ø20–25 → mandrel 6d_be
 *
 * The mandrel diameter is the INSIDE diameter of the bend, so the bar centreline
 * radius is (mandrel + d_b)/2. Getting that wrong by d_b/2 is the classic detailing
 * error that makes a bar cage that will not close.
 *
 * All lengths in metres unless the name says `Mm`. Pure: no store, no runes.
