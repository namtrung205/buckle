/**
 * Label placement, which is a correctness problem wearing a cosmetic disguise.
 *
 * Two values written on top of each other do not look untidy — they look like
 * the numbers are wrong, because neither can be read. And the reader has no way
 * to tell a rendering collision from a bad result.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the BEHAVIOUR a reader relies on: the biggest number
 * stays where they look for it, everything stays attached to what it describes,
 * and nothing ends up on top of a column.
