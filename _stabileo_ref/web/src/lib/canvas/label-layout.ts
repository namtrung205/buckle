/**
 * label-layout.ts — placing labels so they do not land on top of each other.
 *
 * # The problem, stated once
 *
 * Every annotation on the canvas wants to sit at one particular place: a load's
 * value belongs next to its arrow, a member's tag next to the member. When two
 * of them want overlapping places, both become unreadable — and the drawing
 * looks broken in a way that suggests the numbers are wrong rather than merely
 * badly positioned.
 *
 * The previous answer was a per-load `labelYOffset` decided upstream: a
 * hard-coded nudge that had to be maintained by hand, knew nothing about what
 * was actually on screen, and could not react to zoom. Two distributed loads on
 * one beam still collided, because the offset was chosen without looking.
 *
 * # The approach
 *
 * Greedy placement in priority order, which is the standard answer to label
 * collision and the right one here for a specific reason: it lets us decide WHO
 * keeps their preferred spot. The largest load is the one a reader looks for
 * first, so it is placed first and keeps its natural position; smaller ones move
 * out of its way. That produces the ordering by magnitude a reader expects
 * rather than an arbitrary one that depends on element ids.
 *
 * A label displaced along its own preferred direction — outward from the member
 * it annotates — stays visibly attached to what it describes. Displacing it
 * sideways, or to wherever there happens to be room, would break that.
 *
 * # What counts as an obstacle
 *
 * Other labels, and the STRUCTURE itself: a value written across a column is as
 * unreadable as one written across another value, which is what the point-load
 * labels were doing. Members are passed in as segments and treated as thin
 * boxes, so the same routine handles both.
 */

/**
 * Collects every label drawn in one frame so they can be laid out together.
 *
 * Resolving each KIND of load separately is not enough, and the reason is the
 * whole point of this module: a point load's value and a distributed load's
 * value are drawn by different functions, know nothing about each other, and
 * land on the same beam. Whoever ran last won. One collector, passed through
 * the draw context and flushed once, is what makes the guarantee hold across
 * the whole drawing rather than within each renderer.
