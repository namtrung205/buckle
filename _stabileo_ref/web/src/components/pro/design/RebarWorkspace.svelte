  /**
   * The 3-D reinforcement workspace: the whole window, not a corner of it.
   *
   * ── Why this is an overlay at App level ────────────────────────────
   *
   * The viewer was small for a structural reason, not a styling one. It lived at
   * `App → aside.pro-sidebar → ProPanel → ProRcWorkflowTab → DetailingWorkflow →
   * RebarScenePanel → canvas`, and that `aside` takes a fixed pixel width from
   * `uiStore.proPanelWidth`. No amount of width inside it can exceed the sidebar, so
   * inspecting a cage of thousands of bars was being done through a slot a few hundred pixels
   * wide. Widening the sidebar would have traded one cramped surface for another and broken
   * the model view beside it.
   *
   * So the workspace mounts at App level and covers the window. The sidebar keeps the summary
   * and the export; the inspection happens here.
   *
   * ── Why closing does not destroy anything ─────────────────────────
   *
   * All of its state — layers, section, selection, history — lives in `rebarWorkspace`, so
   * the overlay can unmount and come back exactly as it was. And nothing in this file writes
   * to `modelStore`: opening and closing is a view operation, and the project is byte-identical
   * either side of it.

       ── Why the workspace looked like a different application ───────

       The viewer and its four child panels make thirty `var()` calls against
       `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--st-border` and `--panel`. None of those four custom
       properties is defined ANYWHERE in the application. Every call therefore fell through
       to its hard-coded fallback, and the whole 3-D surface ended up painted from a private
       literal palette that no token could reach — not by having chosen its own colours, but
       by pointing at a palette that was never written.

       Defining them here fixes all thirty at once. Custom properties inherit through the
       DOM rather than through component boundaries, and every child renders inside this
       element, so `RebarLayersPanel`, `RebarStatusPanel`, `SelectionDetails` and
       `RebarViewport3D` pick them up without a line changing in any of them.

       The fallbacks stay where they are. If this element is ever bypassed, the viewer
       renders in its old literals rather than unstyled — a worse look, not a broken one.

       What is deliberately NOT aliased: the state colours. Provisional violet, conflict red,
       unreinforced orange and selection yellow are owned by `three/rebar-scene.ts`, which
       feeds numeric hexes to Three.js materials and cannot read a custom property. Aliasing
       the panel's copies would let the picture and the words beside it drift apart.

  /*
     Twenty-six rules stood here and reached nothing.

     They styled the rail's headings, labels, sliders, section-cut button, tally table and
     inspector list — markup that was extracted into `RebarLayersPanel`, `RebarStatusPanel`
     and `SelectionDetails`. Svelte scopes styles to the component that declares them, so the
     moment the markup moved the rules stopped matching, and every one of them was reported as
     an unused selector on every build. The children carry their own copies; nothing here was
     the only definition of anything, which is why deleting them changes no pixel.

     They are gone rather than kept "just in case" for the reason `.autosave-banner` taught:
     a rule left behind after its markup leaves is not a spare, it is a decoy that the next
     person edits expecting an effect.
