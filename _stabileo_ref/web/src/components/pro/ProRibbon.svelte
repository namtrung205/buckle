  /**
   * PRO's command bar: a two-level ribbon.
   *
   * ── Why tabs here, when Basic refuses them ────────────────────────────
   *
   * Basic's ribbon is one permanent row on purpose: its work is a loop —
   * draw, solve, look — crossed many times a minute, and a tab is the wrong
   * control for something you traverse constantly.
   *
   * PRO is not a loop, it is a pipeline. Modelling the geometry and detailing
   * the reinforcement are activities separated by hours, not seconds. That is
   * the same shape Fusion uses tabs for — Solid and Sheet Metal are not two
   * steps of one gesture, they are two trades. So tabs are right here and
   * wrong there; the two modes are different applications.
   *
   * ── What it replaced ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * A single row where four dropdown menus held thirteen destinations and the
   * real commands — Solve, Report, Examples, DXF — were pushed to the far
   * right. Navigation had taken the row that belongs to commands, and no view
   * ever showed the whole structure: you could not see the thirteen
   * destinations together, only whichever menu was open.
   *
   * Now the destinations are buttons under their stage, visible without
   * opening anything, and the commands are back in the row.
   *
   * ── The left column ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Everything left of the rule survives a tab change: the document commands
   * in their 2×2 block, and above them Select and Pan, which are the two
   * controls used at every stage. That is what the rule divides — not
   * decoration, but "this does not belong to any tab".
