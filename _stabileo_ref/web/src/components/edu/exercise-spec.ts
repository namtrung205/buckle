/**
 * exercise-spec.ts — an exercise as DATA rather than as code.
 *
 * # Why
 *
 * An exercise used to carry two functions: `build(api)`, which issued a
 * sequence of calls to construct the structure, and one `getCorrect` per
 * question, which dug the right answer out of the solver's output. Both are
 * TypeScript, so writing an exercise meant writing code, compiling it and
 * shipping it. For a mode whose whole point is having a lot of exercises, that
 * is the binding constraint.
 *
 * Here a structure is a list of nodes, elements, supports and loads, and an
 * answer is a description of what to measure. Nothing executes except this
 * module.
 *
 * # The bug the old shape encouraged
 *
 * Some `getCorrect` functions did not read the solver at all — they returned a
 * literal, `() => 5 * 8 * 8 / 8`. Not laziness: the extractor available for
 * "maximum moment" only looked at the two ENDS of each element, so the
 * mid-span maximum of a distributed load was invisible to it and the author had
 * to supply the value by hand. That works until the exercise changes, at which
 * point the stated answer is silently wrong and nothing notices.
 *
 * `maxAbs*` here sweeps the diagram along each element instead, so the
 * mid-span maximum is found and no answer needs to be written by hand.
