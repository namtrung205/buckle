/**
 * exercise-capture.ts — turn what a teacher DREW into an exercise, and back.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * Making an exercise a data structure was necessary but nowhere near
 * sufficient: a teacher was still expected to edit a TypeScript file, which is
 * programming with different syntax. Authoring has to happen where the
 * structure already gets built — on the canvas, with the tools that are there.
 *
 * So this reads the live model and produces a spec, and writes a spec back into
 * a model. Everything else about authoring is a question of which questions to
 * ask; the structure itself needs no new editor, because the app already is one.
 *
 * # What is deliberately dropped
 *
 * A spec keeps geometry, supports and loads. It does NOT keep materials,
 * sections, load cases, combinations or 3D data. An exercise is a statics
 * problem posed to a student, not a project file: carrying a section through
 * would make two exercises differ by properties nobody asked about, and the
 * answers are checked against the solve rather than against stored numbers.
 * A model with anything unrepresentable is reported, not silently truncated.
