/**
 * exercise-source.ts — the four ways a structure gets into an exercise.
 *
 * # The problem this solves
 *
 * "Take what is drawn" assumed there was something drawn. Switching from Basic
 * to Educational does not carry the model across, so a teacher who had just
 * built a frame in Basic arrived at the authoring panel with an empty canvas
 * and no obvious way back. The button was not wrong; it was the only door in a
 * room that needs four.
 *
 * So: draw it here, load an example, open a `.ded` saved from Basic, or paste a
 * share link from Basic. All four end in the same place — a model in the store,
 * which the capture step then reads.
 *
 * # Why this is a module and not inline in the panel
 *
 * Each route can fail in its own way — a corrupt file, a link from a different
 * app, an example id that no longer exists — and every one of those has to
 * produce a sentence a teacher can act on rather than a silent no-op. That is
 * easier to get right, and far easier to test, outside a component.
