 *
 * # Why presets
 *
 * The first authoring panel made every question a form: pick a force, pick a
 * scope, pick a member, type a label, type a unit. That is five decisions to
 * ask "what is the maximum moment", which is the single most common question in
 * the subject. The form still exists for anything unusual, but the common cases
 * are one click, with their label and unit already right.
 *
 * # Steels
 *
 * `fy` was defaulting to 235, which is the European F-24 the CIRSOC profile
 * tables are computed for — technically consistent and, in an Argentine
 * classroom, not what anyone reaches for first. The named grades below make the
 * choice explicit instead of leaving a bare number that looks arbitrary.
