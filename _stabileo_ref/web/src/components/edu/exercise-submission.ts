/**
 * exercise-submission.ts — what a student hands back.
 *
 * # Why this exists at all
 *
 * A teacher could send an exercise and a student could solve it, and there the
 * workflow stopped: the answers lived in one browser tab and nothing could
 * carry them anywhere. Everything a teacher does with a class — collect, look,
 * mark — happened outside the app, from a screenshot at best.
 *
 * # Why it is a file and a code, and not a server
 *
 * Stabileo is a static site. There is no account, no database and nothing that
 * could receive a POST, and adding one is a different project with a different
 * set of promises (who stores a minor's work, and for how long). So the
 * student's browser produces the artefact and the student hands it over the way
 * they already hand things in: a file for a campus upload, a short code for a
 * chat or an email body.
 *
 * # What a submission is NOT
 *
 * It is a RECORD, not a proof. Everything in it was produced on the student's
 * own machine and can be edited there, exactly like a photo of a notebook page
 * can be staged. The value is that the teacher sees each answer beside the
 * outcome the app gave it, for thirty students, without opening thirty tabs.
 * Nothing here should be read as authentication, and the review screen says so.
