/**
 * edu-reactions.ts — reading solver reactions the way Education grades them.
 *
 * Two defects motivated this module, both invisible until now because no test
 * covered `components/edu/**` and `.svelte` files were outside every type gate:
 *
 * 1. WRONG FIELD NAMES. Education read `reaction.ry` and `reaction.mz`. Those
 *    were the field names of the old TypeScript solver; the WASM migration
 *    (`Remove TS solver files, go WASM-only`) renamed them. The Rust struct
 *    serialises `rx`, `rz` and `my` — `ry`/`mz` survive only as *deserialise*
 *    aliases and are never emitted. So `reaction.ry` was `undefined` on every
 *    solve: every vertical-reaction answer graded incorrect (including the
 *    right one), every moment answer graded against a hard-coded 0, and the
 *    reveal button threw on `undefined.toFixed(2)`.
 *
 * 2. POSITIONAL MATCHING. `reactions[supportIndex]` assumed the solver returns
 *    reactions in the same order the exercise declares its supports. The
 *    engine's own tests never do this — they always look up by `nodeId` — and
 *    the exercises already carried a `nodeIndex` field that nothing read.
 *
 * Everything here reads through the shared display helpers in
 * `geometry/coordinate-system`, so Education grades exactly the numbers the
 * results table shows. No numerics live in this file.

 * - `Rx` — horizontal, straight from the solver.
 * - `Ry` — vertical, positive upward. `get2DDisplayReactionVertical` resolves
 *   the current `rz` field and still accepts a legacy `ry` payload.
 * - `M`  — support moment, **negated**, because `ResultsTable` renders
 *   `-get2DDisplayMoment(r)`. Education must grade what the student can read
 *   on screen, so the sign flip belongs here too.
 *
 * Returns `null` when the reaction cannot be read at all (no results yet, or
 * the node carries no reaction) so callers can refuse to grade rather than
 * compare against a fabricated value.
