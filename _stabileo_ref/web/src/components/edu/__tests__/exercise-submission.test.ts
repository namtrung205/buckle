/**
 * What a student hands back has to survive the trip.
 *
 * A submission leaves the browser as a downloaded file or as a code pasted
 * into a chat window, and is read by a teacher who has thirty of them. The
 * failure that matters is not a crash: it is a truncated download or a code
 * that lost its tail on a line wrap being read as a valid, empty submission —
 * a student marked zero for a transport problem. Every reader here refuses
 * rather than guesses.
