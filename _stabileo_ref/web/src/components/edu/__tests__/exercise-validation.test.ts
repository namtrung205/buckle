/**
 * Every shipped exercise has to actually work.
 *
 * This is the check that makes authoring safe. An exercise is data now, so
 * writing one no longer needs a compiler — but it also no longer gets one
 * looking over your shoulder. What replaces that is this: each exercise is
 * built, solved, and its stated answers are compared against what the solver
 * produces.
 *
 * The failure this exists to prevent is specific and used to be reachable.
 * Several answers were hand-written literals, because the extractor available
 * for "maximum moment" only looked at element ENDS and could not see the
 * mid-span maximum of a distributed load. Nothing compared those literals to
 * the solver, so an exercise whose load or span changed would have gone on
 * stating the old answer — and a student would have been marked wrong for
 * being right.
