/**
 * edu-solver.ts — Educational mode solver service.
 *
 * Self-contained module: uses the shared 2D solver (modelStore.solve) but
 * manages its own result lifecycle. Education deliberately withholds the
 * answer-bearing output — reactions and diagrams stay hidden until the student
 * has answered — so it cannot simply reuse the Basic publish path.
 *
 * What it must NOT withhold is trust information. This module previously
 * skipped the non-finite displacement gate that every Basic solve path runs,
 * and silently discarded every severity-`warning` diagnostic the solver
 * produced, so a degenerate or unreliable result could be used to grade a
 * student. Both now go through the same shared helpers Basic uses.
 *
 * Numerics stay in the shared solver; nothing here computes anything.

// There is deliberately NO window listener here.
//
// This module used to register its own 'stabileo-solve' listener from
// EducativePanel's mount, while `live-calc.runGlobalSolve()` returned early for
// edu mode on the assumption that the edu listener "fires first". Correctness
// therefore depended on listener-registration order, and a solve dispatched
// before EducativePanel mounted did nothing at all.
//
// `runGlobalSolve()` now calls `solveForEdu()` directly. One dispatch path, no
// ordering hazard, no possibility of double-solving.
