   * switch mid-gesture, twenty times while reading a result. They sat in the
   * ribbon among the commands that open panels, which put them in permanent
   * competition with everything else for what the ribbon highlights: after a
   * solve, a lit diagram plus a lit Select meant two commands claimed to be
   * the current activity while the right-hand panel could only show one.
   *
   * Moved here, that contradiction cannot arise. The ribbon highlights what the
   * panel is showing; the pointer mode is a property of the cursor and says so
   * where the cursor is.
   *
   * # Why a toggle rather than two buttons
   *
   * There are exactly two states and they are mutually exclusive, so a single
   * control that shows the CURRENT one and switches on click carries the same
   * information in half the space — and cannot display the impossible state of
   * both or neither, which two buttons can.

<!--
  The tip is a sibling inside the wrapper rather than the native `title`,
  because it has to say three different KINDS of thing: what mode you are in,
  where the rest of that mode's setting lives, and what a click would do. A
  title attribute renders those as one run-on line with no way to rank them,
  and the note is deliberately the quietest of the three — it answers the
  question people arrive with ("it selects members and I want nodes") without
  competing with the two sentences that describe the button itself.
