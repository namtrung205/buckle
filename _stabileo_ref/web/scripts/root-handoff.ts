/**
 * The script the bare root carries, to send a reader to their language.
 *
 * ── Why it is a script at all ──
 *
 * GitHub Pages cannot answer a 302, so the language handoff has to run in the
 * browser. `scripts/prerender.ts` inlines the string this returns into
 * `dist/index.html`, and nothing else on the site depends on it.
 *
 * ── Why it lives in its own file ──
 *
 * It restates `preferredPublicLocale()` from src/lib/i18n/public-routes.ts —
 * first offered language the browser asks for, the fallback otherwise. An
 * inline script cannot import, so the rule genuinely exists twice; what it
 * does not have to be is untested. The TypeScript side has unit tests, and
 * until this was pulled out of prerender.ts the copy that actually ships on
 * the front door of the site had none. It is now the one thing in this file
 * and `__tests__/root-handoff.test.ts` runs it.
 *
 * ── What it must not do ──
 *
 *  · Fire on anything but the bare root. `/es`, `/app/basic` and `/demo` are
 *    already where they belong.
 *  · Fire when 404.html has bounced an application route through `?route=`,
 *    or someone opening a shared model link lands on the marketing page.
 *  · Fire for `?embed`.
 *  · Lose the query string. It did, and only for Spanish and Portuguese
 *    browsers, since a reader whose language is the fallback is never
 *    redirected at all — so `stabileo.com/?utm_source=…` kept its attribution
 *    for the audience the prefixes were NOT built for and lost it for the one
 *    they were.
