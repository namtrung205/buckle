/**
 * How long a solve may take before the setup is declared stuck.
 *
 * ── Why this is a tightening, not a loosening ──────────────────────
 *
 * `page.evaluate` inherits the TEST's timeout, and the heavy specs set that to 900 s so the
 * measurements they take have room. So a solve that never finished consumed the whole
 * fifteen minutes and then failed pointing at the `evaluate` line — no cause, no evidence, and
 * fifteen minutes of a suite spent learning nothing. It happened three times across two runs,
 * always on the 7-storey building, never on the same test twice.
 *
 * ── How this number was chosen, and re-chosen ─────────────────────
 *
 * The 7-storey solve is 20–40 s on an idle machine and the small models are seconds, so the
 * first attempt set this at 240 s — six times headroom, and a quarter of the old budget.
 *
 * It fired. On a run where the cost spec had just spent ten minutes on the same machine, the
 * 7-storey setup solve exceeded four minutes, and the diagnostic reported what it was for:
 * **the parallel solve had NOT fallen back**. The worker pool was up and the solve was simply
 * that slow under accumulated load. So the leading explanation for this suite's one recurring
 * failure is disproven, and 240 s is below what a healthy-but-loaded machine needs.
 *
 * Eight minutes is the calibrated number: still well under the 900 s these specs allow
 * themselves, so a genuine hang still fails in half the time and says why, and far enough above
 * the measured worst case that it does not fire on load alone. Raising it from 240 s is
 * calibration against evidence this deadline produced; it remains a tightening of the 900 s it
 * replaced, and the measurement budgets are untouched either way.
 *
 * The real remedy is fewer full 7-storey setups — the suite runs about thirteen — and that is a
 * spec refactor with a genuine risk of reducing coverage, so it is written up rather than
 * attempted here. See `docs/handoffs/pr19-readiness.md` §9.
