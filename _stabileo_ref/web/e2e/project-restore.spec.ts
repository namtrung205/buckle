/**
 * The returning user's whole path: open, reload, restore, and do the day's work.
 *
 * ── What this file is for ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every failure in this investigation was reachable from one short sequence, and none of them
 * was reachable from the unit suite:
 *
 *   Error al resolver 3D: Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Worker':
 *   [object Array] could not be cloned.
 *
 *   Error en caso 3D "Superimposed dead (screed+finish+partitions)":
 *   Parse error: Error: invalid type: unit value, expected a sequence
 *
 * The causes are owned by `project-restore-roundtrip.test.ts`, which proves each one in
 * isolation. What only a browser can show is that they are GONE from the sequence a person
 * actually performs — and, in one case, that a repair was ever needed at all: the parallel
 * solve had been throwing `DataCloneError` on every solve of any model carrying a constraint,
 * and `solveCombinations3DParallel` caught it and fell back to the sequential solver. Correct
 * results, one thread, and the only trace was a `console.warn` nobody was reading. So a silent
 * fallback is a FAILURE here, not a detail.
 *
 * ── Restored twice, and what the second pass found ─────────────────
 *
 * The journey restores, works, and then reloads and restores AGAIN, because a returning user
 * does not return once.
 *
 * The second pass was written expecting to restore a snapshot carrying the whole design, and
 * for a long time that is not what the app could offer. `localStorage` gives an origin a few
 * megabytes, and this project stopped fitting the moment `designAll` finished: the autosave was
 * written normally after the load and after the solve, and from the design onwards every write
 * threw `QuotaExceededError`. It threw in silence, which is worse than not saving — the key
 * still held the PRE-DESIGN snapshot, so a reload offered a restore banner that handed back the
 * model as it was before the design ran, with nothing reporting the difference.
 *
 * The autosave now lives in IndexedDB, which has no comparable ceiling and stores the object
 * rather than a string. So the second pass asserts what it was written to assert in the first
 * place: the stored project CONTAINS the reinforcement, the restore brings it back, no
 * over-quota warning appears, and the save that happened is the save that is reported.
 *
 * ── Nothing here is a timing ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The forbidden strings are watched on the console and on every toast for the whole run, so a
 * failure is attributed to the step that caused it. The viewport assertions are counters —
 * canvases, WebGL contexts, scene builds — because a browser drops the oldest context without
 * warning past about sixteen, and a leak per open is a viewport that silently stops rendering
 * after a dozen visits.

/**
 * Toasts have to be RECORDED as they are raised, never sampled off the DOM later.
 *
 * A toast removes itself after 4 s (`ui.svelte.ts` `toast()`), and the moment a spec can next
 * look is not under the spec's control: `__stabileoActions.solve()` resolves when the solve
 * resolves, but the evaluate cannot RETURN until the main thread is free, and publishing a
 * restored-and-designed model — 203 reinforced members across 7 combinations — blocks it for
 * about six seconds after the toast goes up. The assertion window then opens on an empty
 * container and stays empty, which reads exactly like a solve that reported nothing.
 *
 * That is what made this file red on main: not a missing toast, a missed one. The first pass
 * survived only because an un-designed model publishes fast enough to still be inside the 4 s.
 *
 * So a MutationObserver installed before any app code runs appends every toast to a page-side
 * log that nothing clears on a timer. `assertClean` gains the same soundness for free — its
