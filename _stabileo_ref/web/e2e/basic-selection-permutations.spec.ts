/**
 * Every combination of selectable kinds, driven through the real app.
 *
 * ── Why this is separate from the unit audit ───────────────────────
 *
 * `box-select.test.ts` already proves the geometry over all fifteen
 * combinations, both gestures and both projections, and proves it by
 * property rather than by fifteen hand-written answers. What it cannot see is
 * the half where the original defect actually lived: the viewport deciding
 * whether to START a drag, reading the armed kinds out of the store, and
 * merging the result into the right selection sets. Three of the four filters
 * drew no rectangle at all, and no amount of geometry testing would have said
 * so.
 *
 * So this file asks the app the same questions the unit audit asks the module,
 * and asks them in both viewports because 2D canvas and 3D camera reach that
 * wiring by different paths.
 *
 * ── The properties ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   * **Isolation** — nothing outside the armed kinds is ever selected. This
 *     is what keeps the highlight and the delete key in step.
 *   * **Window ⊆ crossing** — the same rectangle as a net takes at least what
 *     it takes as a frame.
 *   * **Reach** — every kind is genuinely selectable by a drag. Isolation
 *     alone is satisfied by a viewport that selects nothing at all, which is
 *     precisely the bug being guarded against.
