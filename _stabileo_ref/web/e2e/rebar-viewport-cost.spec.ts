/**
 * What an interaction with the 3-D workspace actually costs, in a real browser.
 *
 * ── Why this exists at all ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because the unit benchmark cannot see the half of the cost that lives in the browser. In Node,
 * building all 20 917 tubes takes about 100 ms; on the 7-storey building a user reported 5,9 s for
 * the first columns toggle and up to 16,7 s for slabs. The difference is everything Node does not
 * do: uploading ~40 MB of vertex data to the GPU, disposing the buffers that were there, and
 * flushing a Svelte derived chain over 20 917 bars on whichever frame comes next.
 *
 * So the fix — batching by family, and answering a switch with `mesh.visible` — has to be measured
 * where the defect was, not where it was convenient to reproduce.
 *
 * ── What is asserted, and what is only reported ────────────────────
 *
 * ASSERTED: that a switch does not rebuild the geometry. Not as a timing — as a COUNTER.
 * `rebarSceneBuilds()` is how many times tubes have been built in the page, and it must not move
 * when a checkbox does. A stopwatch on a shared CI runner can always be explained away; a counter
 * that went up cannot.
 *
 * Also asserted: no WebGL context and no canvas is added by any of it, and no scene projection is
 * rebuilt (`sceneCacheStats().misses`).
 *
 * REPORTED: the milliseconds, as a table, next to the cost of one deliberate rebuild so every row
 * can be read against what it used to cost. They carry two sets of ceilings — a wide one for the
 * default view, whose frame is still dominated by 39 240 conflict markers on a software rasteriser
 * even after their tessellation was cut, and a tight one measured with those markers off, where what
 * is left is the app's own work.
 *
 * ── Setup is never inside a measurement ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Loading, solving and detailing a 203-member model leaves real work queued — measured at ~2 500 ms
 * with no workspace open at all. The first version of the tab-return benchmark timed exactly that
 * and blamed the tab switch. Everything here waits for the setup to settle first, and the settling
 * wait is not part of any number.
 *
 * ── Where the big model comes from now ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Five of these tests set up the 7-storey building, and every one of them is an OBSERVER: they
 * measure what an interaction costs on a scene, not what building the scene costs. Running the
 * whole chain five times in one file measured 12,3 min and left the machine saturated for
 * whatever ran next — half of the starvation diagnosed in
 * `docs/handoffs/pr20-heavy-spec-starvation.md`.
 *
 * So the building is prepared once per worker and opened from the `.ded` the app's own Save
 * button wrote. Each test still gets its own page, its own store and its own WebGL context; see
 * `prepared-building.ts` for why the state travels as a file rather than as a shared page. The
 * small control model is cheap and still runs its own chain, which keeps at least one path
 * through load → design → detail → open measured here.

 * Ceilings, in milliseconds, per model.
 *
 * ── Why the big model's numbers are seconds, and what that IS ──────
 *
 * Not a rebuild. The counter proves that: forty toggles, zero tube builds. What is left on the
 * 7-storey building is the FRAME — and this suite runs Chromium on SwiftShader, a software
 * rasteriser, by deliberate configuration, so every frame is drawn on the CPU.
 *
 * Isolated by probe on this runner, hiding columns on the 7-storey building:
 *
 *     conflict markers on                 7 591 ms
 *     conflict markers off                1 391 ms
 *     conflict markers + concrete off       627 ms
 *
 * The markers are the cost, and the reason is a number worth stating: this document carries 39 240
 * open conflicts. At the 10 × 8 sphere they were built with, that was 5 493 600 triangles of
 * translucent geometry against the reinforcement's own 1 008 672. Cutting them to 6 × 4 took the
 * markers to 1 412 640 and the same switch to about 2 610 ms — 1,9×, not the 3,89× the geometry
 * fell by, because the rest is fill rate: the same screen area, blended, however few triangles
 * cover it.
 *
 * So the budgets below sit above the observed range on this runner, and the spec MEASURES the
 * marker contribution rather than quietly absorbing it into a wide number. What the ceilings catch
 * is an order-of-magnitude regression — the return of the rebuild, which was 5 900–16 700 ms on a
 * real GPU where a frame is not the bottleneck at all.

/**
 * The same gestures with the conflict markers off, held to a real number.
 *
 * ── Why there are two sets of budgets ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because the ceilings above are so wide that on their own they would catch almost nothing, and a
 * budget that catches nothing is worse than no budget: it reads as coverage. They are wide for an
 * honest reason — six million triangles of translucent marker on a software rasteriser — but that
 * reason has nothing to do with the code this work changed.
 *
 * So the sensitive gate runs with the markers switched off, where the frame is cheap and what is
 * left is the app's own work: the filter, the tally, the visibility pass and the raycast. Measured
 * on this runner, hiding a family in that state costs 377 ms and clearing an isolation 176 ms. A
 * returning rebuild would be seconds and would fail here immediately.
 *
 * The bounds carry ~20% headroom over the shared runner's reality, not over the idle-machine
 * numbers above: #155 measured this same 7-storey model class at 2543–2645 ms on the shared CI
 * runner (2026-08-21) and moved its geometry bound 2500→3000 for it. The same treatment is applied
 * here (1500→1800, 2500→3000) — a tight bound calibrated below the runner's observed cost is not a
