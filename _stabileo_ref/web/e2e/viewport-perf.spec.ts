/**
 * Where the 3D viewport actually spends its time.
 *
 * ── Why this spec is shaped the way it is ────────────────────────────────────
 * The viewport renders ON DEMAND: `Viewport3D.svelte` only re-schedules a frame
 * while something needs one (camera motion, animation, held nav key). When the
 * scene is quiet the render loop STOPS. Two consequences drive everything below.
 *
 * 1. There is no such thing as "idle fps". Zero frames render, so a reading taken
 *    while the scene is quiet is not a measurement of idle — it is whatever the
 *    HUD last flushed, frozen. The earlier version of this spec sampled exactly
 *    that and labelled it `idle`; it was really the tail of model LOAD.
 *
 * 2. A sample must cover a window that lies ENTIRELY inside the gesture. The HUD
 *    flushes every ~250ms, unaligned to when a gesture starts, so the first window
 *    after the gesture begins straddles the boundary and mixes in pre-gesture
 *    frames. `sampleCleanWindow` therefore waits for the HUD's `data-flush`
 *    counter to advance TWICE: edge 1 closes the straddling window, edge 2 closes
 *    the first window fully inside the gesture. That second window is the sample.
 *
 * ── Two kinds of rotation, measured separately ───────────────────────────────
 * They take different code paths, and conflating them hides the thing we care about:
 *
 *   • ARROW KEYS orbit the camera by mutating it directly (Viewport3D ~line 411).
 *     They never fire OrbitControls' `start` event, so the orbit LOD is never even
 *     consulted. Holding a key also keeps the loop continuous. This is the honest
 *     FULL-DETAIL cost of one frame of this model.
 *
 *   • MOUSE DRAG goes through OrbitControls, which fires `start` → `setLowDetail(true)`.
 *
 * NOTE the `orbit:mouse` row is NOT automatically "the LOD row". `applyLowDetail`
 * computes `hideDecor = on && heavy`, so with `heavy === false` it hides NOTHING and
 * the row is just "orbit via OrbitControls, full detail". Whether a model is heavy is
 * `isHeavyModel`: `elements + shells + supports*8 > 3000` (>1200 in `sections` mode).
 * Of the models below only la-bombonera qualifies (2476 + 120 + 205*8 = 4236);
 * 3d-building scores 177 and 3d-tower 56, and their measured ratios are 1.01x and
 * 1.00x — nothing collapsed. Read the printed ratio, do not assume.
 *
 * `setPixelRatio(1)` on orbit start is likewise real in production but INERT here:
 * playwright.config forces `--force-device-scale-factor=1` and `deviceScaleFactor: 1`,
 * so devicePixelRatio is already 1 and dropping it is a no-op. It is not part of any
 * difference this harness can observe.
 *
 * ── Reading the numbers ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `calls`, `tris` and `geos` come from `renderer.info` as per-frame counts that do
 * not depend on the GPU — trust these across machines. `calls` and `geos` are exact;
 * `tris` is NOT — the HUD prints it as `(tris/1000).toFixed(0)`, so it is quantised
 * to 1000 and anything under ~500 triangles reads as 0k. They do depend on camera
 * framing, since three.js frustum-culls per object.
 *
 * `renderMs` and `syncMs` are measured INSIDE the page around real work, so they
 * are honest costs, but Playwright runs SwiftShader (software GL): treat them as
 * an A/B signal between rows, never as a real-GPU absolute.
 *
 * `fps` needs one more caveat, and it is the easy way to fool yourself here:
 *   • `orbit:fulldet` is SELF-DRIVEN — the key is held and rAF runs the loop, so
 *     its fps is the app's own rate and is meaningful.
 *   • `orbit:mouse` and `zoom` are HARNESS-DRIVEN — each frame needs a
 *     `page.mouse.move`/`wheel` round trip, which costs far more than a frame.
 *     Their fps measures how fast Playwright can dispatch input, NOT how fast the
 *     app renders. Never compare an fps across those two groups. Compare
 *     `renderMs` instead — it is immune to the dispatch rate.
 *
 * ── Tagging ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `@perf`, deliberately neither `@smoke` nor `@slow`. CI's blocking e2e job runs
 * `--grep @smoke` and its opt-in job runs `--grep @slow` (ci.yml), so nothing here
 * runs in CI. That is on purpose: this is a measuring instrument, not a regression
 * gate, its numbers are only comparable within one machine, and its mouse-driven
 * rows depend on Playwright keeping up with input — under load they stall. The few
 * assertions below are the exceptions that ARE machine-independent, and they are
 * kept deliberately loose.
 *
 * Run: E2E_PORT=<free port> npx playwright test viewport-perf --reporter=list
