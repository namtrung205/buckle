/**
 * The guided walkthroughs, driven the way a reader drives them.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The previous version of `/demo` broke silently. It pointed at eight anchors,
 * six of which stopped existing when the ribbon replaced the left toolbar, and
 * nothing said so — no test covered it, and a tour that spotlights an absent
 * element simply darkens the screen and carries on. It stayed broken for
 * however long it took a person to notice.
 *
 * So the checks here are the ones that catch that class of failure:
 *
 *   * every walkthrough in the menu can be STARTED and its first card appears;
 *   * every step's target exists while that step is showing;
 *   * a step that waits on the reader ADVANCES when the reader does the thing
 *     — which is where two of the three bugs found by hand actually lived;
 *   * nothing is left armed or half-built when a walkthrough ends.
 *
 * ── On `waitFor` ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both hangs found during development were the same mistake in different
 * clothes: a condition that reads something the app cannot wake it for — the
 * size of a Map, the presence of a DOM node. The tests below that place nodes
 * and click a member are the ones that would catch it happening again, and
 * they are the reason this file drives the canvas rather than pressing Next.

/**
 * The section walkthrough waits on a click that opens a panel.
 *
 * ── Retries, declared rather than hidden (2026-08-27) ──
 *
 * Same reasoning as `drawing a beam` above, for a harder version of the same
 * problem. That one clicks a moving target; this one has to LAND a click on an
 * existing member, and it finds the member by guessing — four points down the
 * middle of the canvas, stopping at whichever one changes the step. Placing a
 * node works wherever it lands, which is why the other test is unaffected.
 *
 * The guess is flaky in CI, and the evidence is not circumstantial: the same
 * commit on `feat/pro-steel-m2` failed at 01:36 and passed at 01:41 on
 * 2026-08-27, and `main` went green through this suite at 21:41 the night
 * before. It fails on branches that touch nothing outside `engine/`, and when it
 * goes it takes the specs after it down with it — Playwright reports those as
 * `browser.newContext: Test ended`, so the blame lands on whatever ran next
 * rather than here. It cost PRs #175 and #176 a day each that way.
 *
 * A retry rather than a retag. Moving it to `@slow` would stop it gating the
 * thing it actually guards, and would leave the guess exactly as fragile — the
 * flake would just land on main instead. The suite's rule that a test passing
 * only on retry is a bug is aimed at hiding an UNKNOWN; this is a named,
 * measured gesture problem with the same shape as its neighbour, which is
 * precisely why that one already carries `retries: 2`.
 *
 * This is containment, not a diagnosis, and not the end of it. Nobody could
 * diagnose it before because the failure artifacts never reached CI: both upload
 * paths are dot-directories and `upload-artifact@v4` was dropping them silently.
 * That is fixed in the same change, so the next failure here arrives with its
 * trace, its video and its screenshot. The repair to aim for is asking the app
 * where the member is instead of guessing — still clicking the canvas, which is
 * the point of the test, just not blindly. If the retries stop absorbing it,
 * that is the signal to do that work, not to raise them.
