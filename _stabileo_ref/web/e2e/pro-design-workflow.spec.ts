/**
 * The concrete workflow, as a person reads it.
 *
 * `pro-design-gates.spec.ts` asserts that a disabled command says why. This file asserts the
 * layer above that: that the panel says WHERE YOU ARE, in what ORDER the steps go, which step is
 * next, and that two buttons with different scopes no longer share a label. Those were the
 * complaints that kept PR20 in draft, and none of them is visible to a test that only checks
 * whether a control works.
 *
 * Everything here is read off the screen. Nothing asserts a class name or a colour: the rule the
 * plan document sets — anything the interface says with colour it must also say in words — is
 * exactly what would be untestable if these assertions were about styling.
