/**
 * PR18 — the visible floor-family deliverable, in a browser, in English and Spanish.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every earlier layer of this branch was covered: the engines by unit tests, the production
 * callers by store-level tests over a model built through `modelStore`'s own API, the records
 * and exports by document slices. What no test did was drive the WHOLE thing through a real
 * browser: load a model, solve it, state the ground, dimension a footing, run the design,
 * look at the punching evidence, export the report, the DXF and the spreadsheet, record a
 * review, change an input, watch the document become SUPERSEDED, and regenerate.
 *
 * That gap mattered more than it sounds. The one time this branch DID reach a browser it found
 * two defects in a day that 31 green unit tests had not — a footing edit clearing the solve, so
 * every footing reported "no reaction" no matter how it was dimensioned. Unit tests cover
 * seams; a journey covers the seams between the seams.
 *
 * ── The rules this file follows ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. NOTHING is seeded. `seedDetailing` is not used, no store is injected, and every value
 *     is typed into the real input or chosen from the real select. An injected assembly proves
 *     the renderer accepts a value of that shape and nothing about producing one.
 *  2. The fixture arrives by the normal example path and the solve is the toolbar's own.
 *  3. The Spanish journey asserts on TRANSLATED output and on the engineering identifiers
 *     staying stable across locale — a mark that changes with the language is a mark two
 *     drawings of one project cannot share.
 *
 * `rc-qa-diagnostic-shells` is the fixture because it is the only one that has all of it: a
 * frame, twelve slab panels at +3,00, twelve wall panels, twelve columns — four of them
 * standing at slab nodes, so punching genuinely applies — and seven fixed supports to found.
