/**
 * A disabled command in PRO is a statement about the project, and it has to be readable.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The control matrix (`docs/handoffs/pr20-pro-design-matrix.md`) went through every control on
 * the RC design surface and asked what a test actually touches. Three findings were cheap to
 * close and are closed here; the rest are listed there as pending.
 *
 *  1. **The two EMPTY STATES of the whole tab were untested.** `design-placeholder-solve` and
 *     `design-placeholder-demands` are the entire content of the design tab before anything has
 *     been computed, and nothing referenced either id. "The table is missing" and "the table says
 *     why it is missing" were indistinguishable to the suite.
 *
 *  2. **Every command's DISABLED state was untested.** Each spec that drives a command waits for
 *     it to be enabled first, so the suite proved the commands work and never that they refuse —
 *     and refusing with a reason is most of what this bar does. `detailing-prerequisites`, the
 *     visible sentence naming which members are in the way and how many, was referenced by
 *     nothing at all.
 *
 *  3. **The 1280×720 layout invariant was guarded by a comment.** `.rc-workflow` used to be
 *     `overflow: hidden`, and with the disclosures open the *Generar detallado* button sat at
 *     y = 874 on a 720 px window with `document.elementFromPoint` returning null at its centre:
 *     an ENABLED command outside every scroll path, where a real pointer event lands on nothing
 *     while a programmatic `.click()` still works. A user in that state clicks and the app does
 *     nothing, with no error and no explanation — and no test could have told them apart, because
 *     Playwright's own click bypasses the question by scrolling first.
 *
 * All three run on a fresh page or on the small QA model, so this file adds seconds, not minutes.
