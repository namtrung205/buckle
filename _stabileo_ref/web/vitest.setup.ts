/**
 * Test bootstrap: initialise the WASM engine once per worker.
 *
 * The whole suite depends on the engine — `initSolver()` reads
 * `src/lib/wasm/dedaliano_engine_bg.wasm` directly with `readFileSync` on the
 * Node path, and `vite.config.ts`'s `wasmStubPlugin` only substitutes the
 * generated `.js` glue, never the binary. So a checkout without a local build
 * cannot collect a single test file, not even a pure-UI one.
 *
 * Left alone that surfaces as a bare `ENOENT ... dedaliano_engine_bg.wasm`
 * stack, which reads like a broken test rather than a missing setup step. The
 * two guards below turn both failure modes into instructions.
 *
 * Nothing here changes runtime solver behaviour or the generated bindings —
 * these are pre-flight checks around the same `initSolver()` call the suite
 * has always made.
