//! Warping constant `Cw`, from the Saint-Venant warping function.
//!
//! # Why it is needed
//!
//! `J` alone describes uniform torsion, where every cross-section warps
//! identically and freely. Restrain that warping — at a fixed end, or simply by
//! the moment varying along the member — and the section picks up longitudinal
//! stresses and a second, much stiffer torsional mechanism. `Cw` measures it.
//!
//! It is the term that makes lateral-torsional buckling computable: the elastic
//! critical moment of a beam depends on `G*J` and `E*Cw` together, and for an
//! open profile the warping term usually dominates at the spans that matter.
//! Without `Cw` a section can be analysed but not checked for lateral buckling.
//!
//! # Formulation
//!
//! The warping function `omega` satisfies Laplace's equation with a boundary
//! condition set by the shear flow:
//!
//! ```text
//!   laplacian(omega) = 0                  in Omega
//!   d(omega)/dn = z*n_y - y*n_z           on the boundary
//! ```
//!
//! Pure Neumann again, so `omega` is fixed only up to a constant, removed by
//! the zero-mean gauge. Then, with `omega` measured from the SHEAR CENTRE
//! rather than the centroid, `Cw = integral(omega^2) dA`.
//!
//! That shear-centre requirement is the part that is easy to miss and quietly
//! wrong: taking the warping function about the centroid gives a value that is
//! right only for doubly-symmetric sections and too large for everything else.
//!
//! # Closed sections are refused
//!
//! A multiply-connected section needs a circulation condition per hole here
//! too, exactly as torsion does — the warping displacement has to come back to
//! itself around each cell. Without it the solve overstates `Cw`; measured
//! against an open profile of the same envelope it came out only three times
//! smaller, where the true ratio is orders of magnitude, because a closed cell
//! barely warps at all.
//!
//! Rather than return that, closed sections are refused. Practically nothing
//! is lost: warping restraint is a concern for open profiles, and design codes
//! treat a closed tube's `Cw` as negligible precisely because it is.
